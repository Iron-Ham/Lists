These must be addressed before merge.\n- **[PRE-EXISTING]**: Issues in code **not changed** by this PR. These are technical debt observations that should not block the PR but are valuable to track.\n\nThis distinction helps reviewers focus on what's actionable for the current PR while still surfacing important context about surrounding code quality.\n\n## Scope Detection\n\nDetermine the analysis scope from flags or arguments:\n\n1. **If `--pr` or `--branch` flag provided**:\n   - Detect base branch: check for `main`, then `master`, or use `git merge-base`\n   - Run `git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD` to get all files changed in this branch\n   - Analyze those files and their immediate dependencies\n\n2. **If `--changes` flag provided**:\n   - Run `git diff --name-only HEAD` and `git diff --name-only --cached` for uncommitted changes\n   - Analyze those files and their immediate dependencies\n\n3. **If path argument provided** (e.g., `/deep-review src/features`):\n   - Analyze only that path\n\n4. **If no arguments**:\n   - Default to `--pr` behavior (analyze current branch changes)\n\n## Review Aspects\n\nSelect which aspects to review. Default is `core` (code + errors + arch).\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `code` | CLAUDE.md compliance, bugs, code quality |\n| `errors` | Silent failures, catch blocks, error handling |\n| `arch` | Dependencies, cycles, hotspots, patterns, scale |\n| `types` | Type invariants, encapsulation, design quality |\n| `comments` | Comment accuracy, rot, maintainability |\n| `tests` | Test coverage, quality, critical gaps |\n| `simplify` | Code clarity, refactoring opportunities |\n| `a11y` | WCAG compliance, ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers |\n| `l10n` | Hardcoded strings, i18n readiness, locale handling, RTL |\n| `concurrency` | Race conditions, deadlocks, thread safety, async pitfalls |\n| `perf` | Algorithmic complexity, allocations, caching, rendering, N+1 queries |\n| `core` | code + errors + arch (default) |\n| `full` | All cross-cutting aspects (does not include platform-specific) |\n\n**Platform-specific aspects** (automatically included when relevant, or explicitly requested):\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `ios` | Swift/SwiftUI/UIKit lifecycle, ARC, Apple APIs, App Store compliance |\n| `android` | Activity/Fragment lifecycle, Compose, manifest, Android security |\n| `ts-frontend` | React/Vue/Angular state, SSR/hydration, component patterns, browser APIs |\n| `ts-backend` | Node.js event loop, middleware, ORM, auth, graceful shutdown, API design |\n| `python` | Pythonic idioms, type hints, Django/FastAPI/Flask, packaging |\n| `rust` | Ownership idioms, unsafe auditing, error handling, trait design |\n| `go` | Go idioms, interface design, context propagation, module hygiene |\n| `rails` | Rails conventions, ActiveRecord, migration safety, background jobs |\n| `flutter` | Widget design, state management, Dart idioms, platform channels |\n| `java` | Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, bean lifecycle, enterprise patterns |\n| `dotnet` | ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, LINQ, C# idioms |\n| `php` | Laravel, Composer, Eloquent, Blade, PHP 8+ features |\n| `cpp` | Modern C++ (11/14/17/20), memory safety, RAII, STL, templates |\n| `react-native` | Bridge perf, native modules, platform-specific code paths |\n| `svelte` | Svelte reactivity, SvelteKit routing, compile-time patterns |\n| `elixir` | OTP/GenServer, Phoenix LiveView, BEAM concurrency |\n| `kotlin-server` | Ktor, coroutines, Kotlin idioms for server-side |\n| `scala` | Functional patterns, Akka/Spark, implicits, effect systems |\n| `macos` | AppKit, SwiftUI for macOS, sandboxing, XPC, notarization, desktop integration |\n| `nextjs` | Server/Client Components, App Router, caching, Server Actions, middleware |\n| `vue` | Vue 3 Composition API, Nuxt 3, Pinia, reactivity patterns, template syntax |\n| `django` | Django ORM, DRF, migrations, template security, middleware, signals |\n| `ruby` | Ruby idioms, metaprogramming safety, gem hygiene, RSpec/Minitest patterns |\n| `terraform` | HCL, state management, IAM security, module design, blast radius control |\n| `shell` | Bash/POSIX sh quoting, error handling, portability, CI/CD script safety |\n| `angular` | Angular DI, RxJS, change detection, signals, template safety |\n| `docker` | Dockerfile layers, multi-stage builds, security, PID 1, Compose |\n| `kubernetes` | K8s manifests, resource limits, security contexts, RBAC, probes, Helm |\n| `graphql` | Schema design, resolver N+1, query security, authorization, DataLoader |\n| `github-actions` | Workflow security, secret handling, action pinning, runner config |\n| `mobile` | ios + android |\n| `ts` | ts-frontend + ts-backend |\n| `jvm` | java + kotlin-server + scala |\n| `apple` | ios + macos |\n| `infra` | terraform + shell |\n| `containers` | docker + kubernetes |\n\nPlatform reviewers are **automatically included** when the team lead determines they are relevant based on the changed files and project context. For example, changing `.swift` files in an iOS project will include the iOS reviewer. The team lead uses its judgment to disambiguate — `.swift` in a macOS project triggers macOS (not iOS), `.kt` in a Ktor server won't trigger Android, `.py` in a Django project triggers django (not just python), `.vue` files trigger vue (not ts-frontend), Next.js projects trigger nextjs (not just ts-frontend). Users can also explicitly request platform aspects (e.g., `/deep-review ios`). Platform aspects are never included in `core` or `full` unless detected or explicitly requested.\n\n**Usage examples:**\n```\n/deep-review                    # core review of PR changes (+ auto-detected platforms)\n/deep-review --pr               #

Parse arguments to extract:\n   - Scope flag: `--pr`, `--branch`, `--changes`, or path\n   - Aspects: list of aspects or `core`/`full`\n\n2. Get changed files based on scope:\n   ```bash\n   # For --pr/--branch (detect base branch first)\n   BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null || echo \"HEAD~10\")\n   git diff --name-only $BASE...HEAD\n\n   # For --changes\n   git diff --name-only HEAD\n   git diff --name-only --cached\n   ```\n\n3. **Get detailed diff with line numbers** (for distinguishing new vs pre-existing issues):\n   ```bash\n   # Get the unified diff showing which lines were added/modified\n   git diff $BASE...HEAD --unified=0 | grep -E '^@@|^diff --git'\n   ```\n   This output shows the exact line ranges that were changed. Parse it to build a map of `{file: [changed_line_ranges]}`.\n\n4. Build the scope context string (referred to as `SCOPE_CONTEXT` below):\n   ```\n   SCOPE: Focus analysis on these files and their direct dependencies:\n   {list of changed files}\n\n   CHANGED LINE RANGES (for classifying issues):\n   {file1}: lines {start1}-{end1}, {start2}-{end2}, ...\n   {file2}: lines {start1}-{end1}, ...\n\n   IMPORTANT - Issue Classification:\n   When reporting issues, you MUST classify each issue as one of:\n   - **[NEW]**: Issue is in code that was ADDED or MODIFIED in this PR (within the changed line ranges above)\n   - **[PRE-EXISTING]**: Issue is in code that was NOT changed by this PR (outside the changed line ranges)\n\n   This distinction is critical for PR review. New issues should be fixed before merge.\n   Pre-existing issues are technical debt to track but should not block the PR.\n   ```\n\n### Phase 1.5: Determine Platform Reviewers\n\nAfter obtaining the list of changed files, determine which platform-specific reviewers to include. Available platform reviewers and what they cover:\n\n| Aspect | Covers |\n|--------|--------|\n| `ios` | Swift/SwiftUI/UIKit lifecycle, ARC, Apple APIs, App Store compliance |\n| `macos` | AppKit, SwiftUI for macOS, sandboxing, XPC, notarization, desktop integration |\n| `android` | Activity/Fragment lifecycle, Compose, manifest, Android security |\n| `ts-frontend` | React/Vue/Angular state, SSR/hydration, component patterns, browser APIs |\n| `ts-backend` | Node.js event loop, middleware, ORM, auth, graceful shutdown, API design |\n| `nextjs` | Server/Client Components, App Router, caching, Server Actions, middleware |\n| `vue` | Vue 3 Composition API, Nuxt 3, Pinia, reactivity patterns, template syntax |\n| `python` | Pythonic idioms, type hints, Django/FastAPI/Flask, packaging |\n| `django` | Django ORM, DRF, migrations, template security, middleware, signals |\n| `ruby` | Ruby idioms, metaprogramming safety, gem hygiene, RSpec/Minitest patterns |\n| `rust` | Ownership idioms, unsafe auditing, error handling, trait design |\n| `go` | Go idioms, interface design, context propagation, module hygiene |\n| `rails` | Rails conventions, ActiveRecord, migration safety, background jobs |\n| `flutter` | Widget design, state management, Dart idioms, platform channels |\n| `java` | Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, bean lifecycle, enterprise patterns |\n| `dotnet` | ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, LINQ, C# idioms |\n| `php` | Laravel, Composer, Eloquent, Blade, PHP 8+ features |\n| `cpp` | Modern C++ (11/14/17/20), memory safety, RAII, STL, templates |\n| `react-native` | Bridge perf, native modules, platform-specific code paths |\n| `svelte` | Svelte reactivity, SvelteKit routing, compile-time patterns |\n| `elixir` | OTP/GenServer, Phoenix LiveView, BEAM concurrency |\n| `kotlin-server` | Ktor, coroutines, Kotlin idioms for server-side |\n| `scala` | Functional patterns, Akka/Spark, implicits, effect systems |\n| `terraform` | HCL, state management, IAM security, module design, blast radius control |\n| `shell` | Bash/POSIX sh quoting, error handling, portability, CI/CD script safety |\n| `angular` | Angular DI, RxJS, change detection, signals, template safety |\n| `docker` | Dockerfile layers, multi-stage builds, security, PID 1, Compose |\n| `kubernetes` | K8s manifests, resource limits, security contexts, RBAC, probes, Helm |\n| `graphql` | Schema design, resolver N+1, query security, authorization, DataLoader |\n| `github-actions` | Workflow security, secret handling, action pinning, runner config |\n\n**If the user explicitly requested platform aspects** (e.g., `/deep-review ios`, `/deep-review python rust`), use those directly.\n\n**If the user did not request any platform aspects**, look at the changed files and the project context to decide which platform reviewers are relevant. Use your judgment — examine file extensions, imports, build files, and project structure to determine the right reviewers. Be precise: `.swift` files in a macOS project should trigger macOS (not iOS), `.kt` files in a Ktor server should not trigger Android, `.ts` files in an Express app should trigger `ts-backend` not `ts-frontend`, `.vue` files should trigger `vue` (not `ts-frontend`), projects with `next.config.*` should trigger `nextjs`, projects with Django's `settings.py`/`manage.py` should trigger `django`, `.tf` files should trigger `terraform`, `.sh`/`.bash` files should trigger `shell`, Angular projects (`angular.json`) should trigger `angular`, `Dockerfile`/`docker-compose.yml` should trigger `docker`, K8s manifests (YAML with `apiVersion`/`kind`) should trigger `kubernetes`, `.graphql`/`.gql` files or GraphQL schema definitions should trigger `graphql`, `.github/workflows/*.yml` files should trigger `github-actions`. When genuinely uncertain, skip rather than guess wrong — the user can always request a platform reviewer explicitly.\n\n**Group alias expansion**:\n- `mobile` → `ios`, `android`\n- `ts` → `ts-frontend`, `ts-backend`\n- `jvm` → `java`, `kotlin-server`, `scala`\n- `apple` → `ios`, `macos`\n- `infra` → `terraform`, `shell`\n- `containers` → `docker`, `kubernetes`\n\n**Merge behavior**:\n- Platform aspects are **added to** whatever cross-cutting aspects the user requested\n- Platform aspects are never included in `core` or `full` expansion — they only come from auto-detection or explicit request\n- Deduplicate: if auto-detection finds `ts-frontend` and the user also typed `ts`, only include `ts-frontend` once\n\n### Phase 2: Determine Which Agents to Launch\n\nBased on selected aspects (including any auto-detected platform aspects from Phase 1.5):\n\n| Aspect | Agents to Launch |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| `core` | Code Reviewer, Silent Failure Hunter, all 5 Architecture agents |\n| `full` | All agents below |\n| `code` | Code Reviewer |\n| `errors` | Silent Failure Hunter |\n| `arch` | Dependency Mapper, Cycle Detector, Hotspot Analyzer, Pattern Scout, Scale Assessor |\n| `types` | Type Design Analyzer |\n| `comments` | Comment Analyzer |\n| `tests` | Test Analyzer |\n| `simplify` | Code Simplifier |\n| `a11y` | Accessibility Scanner |\n| `l10n` | Localization Scanner |\n| `concurrency` | Concurrency Analyzer |\n| `perf` | Performance Analyzer |\n| `ios` | iOS Platform Reviewer |\n| `macos` | macOS Platform Reviewer |\n| `android` | Android Platform Reviewer |\n| `ts-frontend` | TypeScript Frontend Reviewer |\n| `ts-backend` | TypeScript Backend Reviewer |\n| `nextjs` | Next.js Reviewer |\n| `vue` | Vue.js Reviewer |\n| `python` | Python Reviewer |\n| `django` | Django Reviewer |\n| `ruby` | Ruby Reviewer |\n| `rust` | Rust Reviewer |\n| `go` | Go Reviewer |\n| `rails` | Rails Reviewer |\n| `flutter` | Flutter Reviewer |\n| `java` | Java Reviewer |\n| `dotnet` | .NET Reviewer |\n| `php` | PHP Reviewer |\n| `cpp` | C/C++ Reviewer |\n| `react-native` | React Native Reviewer |\n| `svelte` | Svelte Reviewer |\n| `elixir` | Elixir Reviewer |\n| `kotlin-server` | Kotlin Server Reviewer |\n| `scala` | Scala Reviewer |\n| `terraform` | Terraform Reviewer |\n| `shell` | Shell/Bash Reviewer |\n| `angular` | Angular Reviewer |\n| `docker` | Docker Reviewer |\n| `kubernetes` | Kubernetes Reviewer |\n| `graphql` | GraphQL Reviewer |\n| `github-actions` | GitHub Actions Reviewer |\n\n### Phase 3: Initialize Team and Launch Teammates\n\n1. **Create results directory**:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p /tmp/deep-review-$(uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')/\n   ```\n   Store the path as `REVIEW_DIR`.\n\n2. **Create the team**:\n   Use `TeamCreate` with name `\"deep-review\"`.\n\n3. **Create tasks** for each selected agent:\n   Use `TaskCreate` for each agent with:\n   - Subject: `\"Run {agent-display-name} analysis\"`\n   - Description: includes the output file path `{REVIEW_DIR}/{agent-id}.md`\n\n4. **Spawn all analysis teammates in parallel**:\n   For each selected agent, use the Task tool:\n   - `subagent_type`: `\"general-purpose\"`\n   - `model`: from dispatch table (`opus` or omit for inherit)\n   - `team_name`: `\"deep-review\"`\n   - `name`: `\"{agent-id}\"` (e.g., `\"code-reviewer\"`, `\"cycle-detector\"`)\n   - `prompt`: use the Teammate Prompt Template below, filled in with the agent's details\n\n### Phase 4: Monitor Task Completion\n\n1. Wait for summary messages from all teammates (they will send a brief message via SendMessage when done)\n2. Verify via `TaskList` that all analysis tasks show `\"completed\"`\n3. For any tasks that did not complete, check if the output file exists anyway (partial findings are still valuable)\n4. Build a gap report string listing any agents that failed to produce output\n\n### Phase 5: Launch Synthesis Teammate\n\n1. **Create a synthesis task**:\n   Use `TaskCreate` with subject `\"Synthesize findings into unified report\"`.\n\n2. **Spawn the synthesis teammate**:\n   - `subagent_type`: `\"general-purpose\"`\n   - `team_name`: `\"deep-review\"`\n   - `name`: `\"synthesizer\"`\n   - `prompt`: Include the following in the prompt:\n     - Path to the synthesis instructions file: `agents/synthesizer.md`\n     - The `REVIEW_DIR` path\n     - The list of expected output files (one per agent that was launched)\n     - The gap report (if any agents failed)\n     - The scope description (for the report header)\n     - Instruction to write the final report to `{REVIEW_DIR}/REPORT.md`\n     - Instruction to mark the synthesis task as completed and send a message to `\"team-lead\"` when done\n\n3. Wait for the synthesis teammate to complete.\n\n### Phase 6: Present Report and Cleanup\n\n1. **Read the report**: Read `{REVIEW_DIR}/REPORT.md` and present its contents to the user\n2. **Shutdown teammates**: Send shutdown requests to all teammates\n3. **Clean up team**: Use `TeamDelete` to clean up team infrastructure\n4. **Inform the user**: Let them know individual agent findings are available at `{REVIEW_DIR}/` for detailed inspection\n\n## Teammate Prompt Template\n\nThis is the standardized prompt given to each analysis teammate. Fill in the placeholders before sending.\n\n```\nYou are a specialized code analysis agent on the \"deep-review\" team.\n\n## Your Task\n\n1. Read your analysis instructions from: {AGENT_FILE_PATH}\n   (This is relative to the skill directory. Use the Read tool to read the file.)\n2. Analyze the code following those instructions\n3. Write your complete findings to: {OUTPUT_FILE_PATH}\n4. Mark your task as completed via TaskUpdate (task ID: {TASK_ID})\n5. Send a brief summary to \"team-lead\" via SendMessage\n   - Include only counts (e.g., \"Found 3 critical, 2 important new issues; 5 pre-existing issues\")\n   - Do NOT include detailed findings in the message — they are in the output file\n\n## Scope Context\n\n{SCOPE_CONTEXT}\n\nNote: Your analysis instructions reference `{SCOPE_CONTEXT}`.\nThis refers to the Scope Context provided directly above — use it as-is.\n\n## Output File Format\n\nWrite your findings as a markdown file. Start with a heading identifying the agent,\nthen list all findings using the output format specified in your analysis instructions.\n\n## Classification Rules\n\nWhen classifying issues as [NEW] or [PRE-EXISTING], use the changed line ranges\nprovided in the Scope Context above. Issues in changed lines are [NEW]; all others\nare [PRE-EXISTING].\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf you encounter errors during analysis (e.g., files not found, permission issues):\n- Write partial findings to the output file along with an ERROR section describing what went wrong\n- Mark the task as completed anyway (so the pipeline is not blocked)\n- Note the error in your summary message to team-lead\n\n## Important\n\n- Do NOT modify any source code files — this is a READ-ONLY analysis\n- Write your findings ONLY to the output file path specified above\n- Be thorough but focused — quality over quantity\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n- Run `/deep-review --pr` before creating a PR to catch issues early\n- Use `core` (default) for quick essential checks\n- Use `full` for comprehensive review before major merges\n- **Focus on [NEW] issues** - these must be fixed before merge\n- **[PRE-EXISTING] issues** are technical debt to track, not PR blockers\n- Re-run after fixes to verify resolution\n- Use specific aspects (e.g., `types tests`) when you know the concern\n- Platform reviewers are automatically included when relevant — no need to specify them manually\n- Use `mobile`, `ts`, or explicit platform names (e.g., `ios`, `python`) to force specific platform reviewers\n- Create follow-up tickets for critical pre-existing issues discovered during review\n- Individual agent findings are available in `/tmp/deep-review-*/` for detailed inspection\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"295434dc-4ec6-4516-8f3e-8b328c00512f","timestamp":"2026-02-23T20:43:39.989Z"}

I should include the `ios` platform reviewer.\n\n3. **Aspects**: Default is `core` (code + errors + arch), plus auto-detected platform `ios`.\n   \nNow I'm reviewing the actual source changes. There are several configuration files being modified (GroupedList, OutlineList, SimpleList), along with new files for auto-reconfiguration and a ListConfigurable protocol, plus updates to the data source implementations and tests.\n\nFor this refactoring, I'm assembling a team of 8 agents: the core reviewers (Code Reviewer, Silent Failure Hunter, Dependency Mapper, Cycle Detector, Hotspot Analyzer, Pattern Scout, Scale Assessor) plus the iOS Platform Reviewer since this is an iOS project.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1726,"cache_read_input_tokens":56589,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1726,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"}},"requestId":"req_011CYRenJxEE8p4jkBUGQgP8","type":"assistant","uuid":"6aec5a20-dade-4852-8e26-4cd8774cee91","timestamp":"2026-02-23T20:44:05.641Z"}

This drops collapsed children from the snapshot entirely and loses UIKit's native hierarchy management.

Having both layers available creates ambiguity about which abstraction \"owns\" these operations.\n    35→- **Fix**: Verify these bridge methods have no remaining callers and remove them (~75-80 lines).

Two important items to consider before merge.\n\n---\n\n### NEW Issues (address before merge)\n\n#### 1. Section snapshot `apply` flattens hierarchy, losing expand/collapse state\n**Location**: `ListDataSource.swift:99-116`\n\nThe new `apply(_:to:animatingDifferences:)` converts a `DiffableDataSourceSectionSnapshot` into a flat `DiffableDataSourceSnapshot` using only `visibleItems`. This drops collapsed children entirely and bypasses UIKit's native hierarchy management. The primary path through `OutlineList.setItems` still calls the native section snapshot apply directly, so this mainly affects callers using `ListDataSource.apply(_:to:)` directly.\n\n**Fix**: The flattening behavior is documented in the doc comment (good!). Verify this is intentional for direct callers. Consider an alternative that computes reconfigure items separately and calls `reconfigureItems` after the native section snapshot apply, preserving full hierarchy.\n\n#### 2. Dead code in `ListConfigurationBridge` creates confusion about canonical API layer\n**Location**: `ListConfigurationBridge.swift:135-213` (~75-80 lines)\n**Flagged by**: 5 agents (pattern-scout, hotspot-analyzer, scale-assessor, dependency-mapper, ios-platform-reviewer)\n\nAfter introducing `ListConfigurable`, the bridge still contains 6 methods (`selectItem`, `deselectItem`, `isSelected`, `scrollToItem`, `scrollToTop`, `scrollToBottom`) whose callers were removed and replaced by `ListConfigurable` protocol extension methods. Having both layers available creates ambiguity.\n\n**Fix**: Verify these bridge methods have no remaining callers and remove them to complete the deduplication story.\n\n---\n\n### Suggestions (nice-to-have)\n\n| # | Issue | Location |\n|---|-------|----------|\n| 3 | `computeItemsToReconfigure` lacks explicit `internal` access modifier | `AutoReconfigure.swift:16` |\n| 4 | `numberOfItems`/`numberOfSections` each call `snapshot()` independently — two copies if both accessed in sequence | `ListConfigurable.swift:81-88` |\n| 5 | `scrollToBottom` is a no-op before layout completes (not a regression, but could use a doc comment) | `ListConfigurable.swift:148-155` |\n| 6 | Section snapshot flattening logic duplicated between `ListDataSource` and `MixedListDataSource` — could be shared like `computeItemsToReconfigure` | Both data source files |\n\n---\n\n### Pre-existing Issues (tech debt, not PR blockers)\n\n| # | Issue | Location |\n|---|-------|----------|\n| 1 | `UIScrollViewDelegate` forwarding duplicated across all 3 configurations (~120 lines total) — `@objc` prevents protocol extension extraction | All 3 config files |\n| 2 | Bridge initialization ceremony is fragile — no compile-time enforcement of correct wiring order | Each config's `init` |\n| 3 | Closure-based callbacks (`onSelect`, `onDelete`, etc.) risk retain cycles without `[weak self]` doc guidance | All 3 config files |\n\n---\n\n### Architecture Health\n\n| Check | Status |\n|-------|--------|\n| No circular dependencies | Pass |\n| Clean layer boundaries | Pass |\n| No god modules | Pass |\n| Consistent patterns | Pass |\n| Scalable structure | Pass |\n| Concurrency safety | Pass |\n| Performance efficiency | Pass |\n| Platform conventions | Pass |\n\n---\n\n### Strengths\n\n- **Clean deduplication**: `ListConfigurable` extracts ~120 lines of duplicated convenience API per configuration into a single protocol extension with only 4 required members\n- **Minimal coupling**: `computeItemsToReconfigure` is a pure function over value types with a single closure parameter — cleanest possible form of shared dependency\n- **Thorough test coverage**: New tests cover the section snapshot apply path including hierarchical parent-child relationships\n- **Correct `@objc` handling**: The PR correctly keeps `UIScrollViewDelegate` forwarding in each configuration rather than attempting the protocol extension (which wouldn't work)\n- **No architectural regressions**: Clean acyclic dependency graph maintained\n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n**Why `@objc` blocks protocol extension deduplication**: Swift protocol extensions cannot provide `@objc` method implementations because Objective-C dispatch uses the class vtable, not Swift's witness table. `UIScrollViewDelegate` and `UICollectionViewDelegate` methods must be dispatched via `@objc`, so they must live directly on each `NSObject` subclass — protocol extensions simply cannot participate in that dispatch mechanism. This is a fundamental Swift/ObjC interop limitation, not a design oversight.\n\n**The \"pure function with closure\" pattern**: `computeItemsToReconfigure` is an excellent example of extracting shared logic from types with different generic constraints. Rather than fighting the type system with protocols or type erasure, a free function with a closure parameter (`isEqual: (Item, Item) -> Bool`) lets each caller inject its own equality strategy. This avoids coupling the shared algorithm to any specific `ContentEquatable` or `AnyItem` type.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\n---\n\nIndividual agent findings are available at `/tmp/deep-review-efd4e29e-43f4-4785-ab47-694d181b2be6/` for detailed inspection."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":95,"cache_read_input_tokens":82982,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":95,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"}},"requestId":"req_011CYRfFHTSSUwu11sVq12f1","type":"assistant","uuid":"d53d60f3-ec63-4945-8fe1-83d38dddefc6","timestamp":"2026-02-23T20:50:34.393Z"}

Let me plan the changes:\n\n### NEW Issues to Fix:\n\n**1. Dead code in `ListConfigurationBridge`** — Remove `scrollToItem`, `selectItem`, `deselectItem`, `isSelected`, `scrollToTop`, `scrollToBottom` from the bridge since they're now provided by `ListConfigurable`.\n\nLet me first verify these bridge methods have no remaining callers. Let me search for them.\n\n**2. Section snapshot apply flattens hierarchy** — This is documented behavior in the doc comments, and the OutlineList uses `dataSource.apply(sectionSnapshot, to: 0, ...)` which goes through the flattening path. I need to verify this is intentional. Actually, wait — looking at the code:\n\n\nIn `OutlineList.setItems`, the section snapshot gets flattened when applied to the data source, which then routes through the standard flat apply path. But OutlineList maintains its own `currentSectionSnapshot` separately to track the hierarchy for expand/collapse operations, while the underlying `ListDataSource` wraps `CollectionViewDiffableDataSource` which doesn't use UIKit's native section snapshot API.\n\nSo the flattening is by design — `visibleItems` from the section snapshot determine what gets displayed, and the snapshot itself is preserved in `currentSectionSnapshot` for hierarchy management. The doc comment already explains this behavior, so I think the current implementation is correct and intentional.\n\nThough I should double-check the review's concern about direct callers of `ListDataSource.apply(_:to:)` — OutlineList uses it correctly, but I need to verify if there are other consumers that might be affected.\n\nThe more pressing issue is the dead code in the bridge that the review flagged. And looking at the pre-existing problems, there's significant duplication in UIScrollViewDelegate methods across three classes — all of them are NSObject subclasses, so I could potentially consolidate this using a shared delegate proxy instead of repeating the same methods. The real constraint is that UICollectionView only accepts a single delegate object, so I can't split the responsibility across multiple objects. Moving the scroll view forwarding into the bridge won't work since the bridge doesn't conform to UIScrollViewDelegate. I'm realizing the duplication might just be acceptable here given the architectural constraints. the bridge is already a `final class` with generics. We can't make it conform to `UIScrollViewDelegate` since it's not an NSObject.\n\nI think the simplest approach is to leave this as-is since AGENTS.md already documents this limitation. Adding a proxy pattern would introduce unnecessary complexity for just ~30 lines per class.\n\nBut the user wants ALL pre-existing issues fixed. Let me reconsider.\n\nA shared base class won't work because the three list types have different SectionID types and vastly different implementations beyond delegate methods. I could extract the common delegate logic into a helper that each class delegates to, then define the protocol methods that each class conforms to...\n\nStill writing delegate pattern... where the default implementation calls through to the forwarder... no, still can't do @objc in protocol extensions.\n\nOK, I think the genuinely cleanest approach here, given Swift's limitations, is to recognize that this is just an inherent language limitation and the code is already as clean as it can be. The AGENTS.md says so too.\n\nBut wait — I just re-read the issue. The review says \"Could potentially be addressed with a shared NSObject subclass or a delegate proxy pattern, though the complexity may not be justified for only 3 consumers.\"\n\nGiven that this is flagged as pre-existing tech debt and the complexity might not be justified, let me consider what the user really wants. They said \"fix all pre-existing issues, fix all new issues.\" But some of these may genuinely be unfixable without adding worse complexity. I'll address what I can and explain what I can't.\n\nLet me re-evaluate the full list. The new issues are mostly actionable — I can remove the dead bridge methods, add the internal access modifier, optimize those redundant snapshot calls, document the pre-layout behavior for scrollToBottom, and extract the duplicated section snapshot flattening logic into a shared helper. The section snapshot flatten itself is already documented as intentional, so I just need to verify the usage is correct.\n\nFor pre-existing issues: the UIScrollViewDelegate forwarding is genuinely constrained by @objc limitations, but I can add a comment explaining why. The bridge initialization ceremony is fragile and I can add a convenience init or validation. The closure callbacks risk retain cycles and I should add doc comments.\n\nLet me start with the new issues since those are most

A `CellViewModel` must:\n1. Conform to `Hashable` and `Sendable`\n2. Declare an associated `Cell` type (a `UICollectionViewCell` subclass)\n3. Implement `func configure(_ cell: Cell)` to bind data to the cell\n\nThe default `Hashable`/`Equatable` implementations derive from `id`, provided by the `CellViewModel+Identifiable.swift` extension. Override only when content-based equality is needed.\n\n### Result Builder DSL\n\nThe builders allow declarative snapshot construction:\n```swift\ndataSource.apply {\n  SnapshotSection(\"favorites\") {\n    for item in favorites { item }\n  }\n  if showRecents {\n    SnapshotSection(\"recents\") {\n      for item in recents { item }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`@SnapshotBuilder` and `@MixedSnapshotBuilder` are top-level; `@ItemsBuilder` and `@MixedItemsBuilder` are used inside sections.\n\n### SwiftUI Integration\n\nSwiftUI wrappers use `UIViewRepresentable`. The `SwiftUICellViewModel` protocol extends `CellViewModel` with a SwiftUI `body` and optional `accessories`. `InlineCellViewModel` is the type-erased version for inline closures.\n\n### Mixed vs Single-Type\n\n- `ListDataSource<Item>` — fastest path, no type erasure\n- `MixedListDataSource` — wraps items in `AnyItem`, has measured overhead (~15-30%)\n- Prefer single-type unless the list truly has heterogeneous cell types\n\n## Critical Patterns\n\n### Task Serialization (`applyTask` chain)\n\nAny method that calls `await dataSource.apply(...)` **must** participate in the `applyTask` serialization chain. `@MainActor` does not prevent interleaving — `await` creates suspension points where other `@MainActor` code can run. Without serialization, overlapping applies corrupt snapshot state or header/footer dictionaries.\n\nThe pattern (used in `GroupedList.setSections`, `OutlineList.setItems`/`expand`/`collapse`, `MixedListDataSource.apply(content:)`):\n\n```swift\napplyTask?.cancel()\nlet previousTask = applyTask\nlet task = Task { [weak self] in\n  _ = await previousTask?.value          // wait for previous to finish\n  guard !Task.isCancelled, let self else { return }\n  // ... build snapshot, merge headers ...\n  await apply(snapshot, animatingDifferences: animatingDifferences)\n  // ... trim headers ...\n}\napplyTask = task\nawait withTaskCancellationHandler {\n  await task.value\n} onCancel: {\n  task.cancel()\n}\n```\n\nIf you add a new `async` method that applies snapshots, **you must use this pattern**.\n\n### Header/Footer Merge-Then-Trim\n\nWhen storing supplementary text (headers/footers) in dictionaries keyed by section ID, use the merge-then-trim strategy around animated applies:\n\n1. **Merge** new values into existing dictionaries *before* applying the snapshot — ensures both old (animating out) and new sections resolve valid text during the transition\n2. **Trim** to only new values *after* the apply completes — prevents stale entries from leaking\n\nThis pattern exists in `GroupedList.setSections` and `MixedListDataSource.apply(content:)`.\n\n### ListConfigurable Protocol\n\nThe `ListConfigurable` protocol (in `Protocols/ListConfigurable.swift`) provides shared convenience APIs across `SimpleList`, `GroupedList`, and `OutlineList`. It derives ~15 default implementations from just four requirements: `collectionView`, `snapshot()`, `itemIdentifier(for:)`, and `indexPath(for:)`.\n\nWhen adding a new convenience property or method that applies to all list configurations:\n1. **Add it to `ListConfigurable`'s protocol extension** — all three configurations get it automatically\n2. If the API needs configuration-specific behavior, add it directly to each configuration instead\n3. `@objc` delegate methods (UICollectionViewDelegate, UIScrollViewDelegate) cannot be provided by protocol extensions — these remain duplicated by necessity\n\n### Shared autoReconfigure Algorithm\n\nThe `computeItemsToReconfigure` function (in `DataSource/AutoReconfigure.swift`) implements the content-change detection algorithm shared by `ListDataSource` and `MixedListDataSource`. Each data source passes its own equality closure:\n- `ListDataSource`: type-level `ContentEquatable` check + `isContentEqualTypeErased`\n- `MixedListDataSource`: `AnyItem.isContentEqual(to:)` (per-item type erasure)\n\n## When Modifying This Module\n\n- New `CellViewModel` features must work with both `ListDataSource` and `MixedListDataSource`\n- Result builders must support `if`/`else`, `for`, and `Optional` in all positions\n- SwiftUI wrappers must call `updateUIView` correctly (avoid unnecessary reloads)\n- All configurations are `@MainActor` — don't break actor isolation\n- Any new `async` method that applies snapshots must use the `applyTask` serialization chain (see above)\n- Run `make test-lists` to verify changes\n- Run `make docs` if you changed any public API, doc comments (`///`), or files under `Lists.docc/` — commit the updated `docs/` output\n","numLines":155,"startLine":1,"totalLines":155}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0a0dcfdb-1d8e-4c93-a1c9-ba259a6afbe4"}

Let me plan all the changes I need to make:\n\n### NEW Issues:\n\n**1. Dead bridge methods** — Remove `scrollToItem`, `selectItem`, `deselectItem`, `isSelected`, `scrollToTop`, `scrollToBottom` from `ListConfigurationBridge.swift` (lines 135-213).\n\n**2. Section snapshot flattening verification** — The code is intentional and documented. No code changes needed.\n\n### Suggestions:\n\n**3. Add explicit `internal` to `computeItemsToReconfigure`** — Add `internal` access modifier.\n\n**4. Redundant `snapshot()` calls** — `numberOfItems` and `numberOfSections` each call `snapshot()` independently. I can change them to use `collectionView.numberOfSections` and a loop for `numberOfItems`, or just leave them. Actually, the cleaner fix is to use UICollectionView directly:\n\n\n- `numberOfSections` → `collectionView.numberOfSections`\n- `numberOfItems` → Sum of `collectionView.numberOfItems(inSection:)` across sections\n\nThe snapshot approach does give a consistent point-in-time view, but using the collection view's methods directly is equally valid and avoids the overhead of creating a snapshot copy.\n\nComputing `numberOfItems` by summing across sections and `numberOfSections` directly from the collection view is simpler and cheaper than the snapshot approach.\n\nI should also add a doc comment to `scrollToBottom` about requiring layout to be complete, and then look at extracting the shared section snapshot flattening logic that's duplicated elsewhere.\n\nExamining the `apply` methods in both data sources, I'm seeing they follow the same pattern of capturing the old snapshot, validating the section exists, removing old items, and then applying the new visible items. Extracting a generic helper function... Finishing the snapshot application, then I'm deciding where to place this helper function—it makes sense to add it to `AutoReconfigure.swift` since both this and `computeItemsToReconfigure` are shared data source utilities. I'm also noting the UIScrollViewDelegate forwarding duplication as a known limitation that I'll document rather than over-engineer with a proxy pattern. approach I haven't considered: Since the scroll view delegate forwarding is identical code and only needs a `weak var scrollViewDelegate: UIScrollViewDelegate?` property, we can't add it to a protocol extension... But we COULD use a macro. Or we COULD use a code template.\n\nActually, the pragmatic answer: these 10 methods are 40 lines each class × 3 = 120 lines total. They're purely mechanical forwarding. The best we can do within Swift's type system is acknowledge the duplication with a clear comment and move on. The review itself says \"the complexity may not be justified.\"\n\nBut the user said \"fix all.\" So let me think once more... What if I create an `@objc protocol ScrollViewDelegateForwarding` that each class conforms to, and use method dispatch? No, that doesn't help with the implementation. What if each class uses a helper method to forward calls? That won't work either — I can't invoke arbitrary delegate methods by string name.\n\nI'll document this as a known limitation with a clear MARK comment and accept that duplication is the right call given Swift's constraints. For the bridge initialization, the safety is already there through optional chaining and assertions, and the order concern is documented. The real issue is just the ceremony around setup, which is acceptable. I need to reconsider the approach since the bridge is created before the data source is available, so a factory method won't work. The real issue is that `itemIdentifier` and `indexPath` return nil silently when the data source isn't set yet, which could hide bugs. I should add assertion guards in those methods similar to what swipe actions already do, but I need to be careful because `resolveSeparator` explicitly documents why it doesn't assert—separators can fire during early layout before the data source is configured.\n\nLooking at the actual usage, all three callers are correct and there's no way to statically enforce the ordering, so I'll leave the optional chaining as-is. Instead, I'll focus on three concrete improvements: removing six dead methods from ListConfigurationBridge, adding the `internal` access modifier to `computeItemsToReconfigure` and creating a shared `flattenSectionSnapshot` function in AutoReconfigure, and adding `[weak self]` guidance to the callback property documentation to prevent retain cycles.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the specific file changes: ListConfigurationBridge needs those six dead methods removed, AutoReconfigure gets the new shared helper and access modifier, ListConfigurable needs to switch to using `collectionView` directly for item and section counts, ListDataSource and MixedListDataSource will use the new shared helper, and the list implementations need updated callback docs.\n\nBefore I start making changes, I should verify that calling `collectionView.numberOfItems(inSection:)` produces the same result as `snapshot().numberOfItems` — and it should, since the collection view's internal state is always consistent with the last applied snapshot.\n\nFor the implementation, I'm using a reduce function to sum up items across all sections rather than creating a snapshot copy, which is more efficient. The `numberOfSections` property just directly returns the collection view's section count.\n\nNow I'm thinking through which callback properties need weak self warnings—basically all the stored closures like `onSelect`, `onDeselect`, `onDelete`, the swipe action providers, context menu provider, and the various data source callbacks could create retain cycles if the view controller holding the list captures itself directly in the closure.\n\nRather than cluttering every single callback with a warning across all three classes, I think the cleanest approach is to add a single note at the class level explaining the retain cycle risk, then maybe highlight it on the most prominent callback like `onSelect` so it's visible to users right away. callback) in each class, since it serves as the exemplar:\n\n```swift\n/// Called when the user taps an item.\n///\n/// - Important: This closure is stored strongly. If the closure captures the list's\n///   owner (e.g. a view controller), use `[weak self]` to avoid a retain cycle.\npublic var onSelect: (@MainActor (Item) -> Void)?\n```\n\nActually, that's adding noise to every callback. A better approach: add a single doc paragraph to the class doc comment that covers all callbacks at once:\n\n```\n/// ## Closure Callbacks\n///\n/// Callback properties (`onSelect`, `onDelete`, `trailingSwipeActionsProvider`, etc.) are\n/// stored strongly. If the closure captures the list's owner, use `[weak self]` to avoid\n/// a retain cycle.\n```\n\nThis is the most practical solution. Let me add it to each of the 3 class doc comments.\n\nNow for the UIScrollViewDelegate duplication—since I can't eliminate it due to @objc requirements, I'll add a clear comment explaining why the duplication exists, making it self-documenting.\n\nHere's my sequence of edits: remove the dead bridge methods, update AutoReconfigure.swift with internal visibility and the flattened snapshot helper, update ListConfigurable.swift with the item/section count methods and scrolling docs, refactor ListDataSource.swift and MixedListDataSource.swift to use the new helper, add retain cycle guidance to the three list class comments, and finally document the @objc duplication pattern.\n\nStarting

2026-02-20\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed Mac Catalyst refresh control guard to use process-level `UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom` instead of `UIView.behavioralStyle`, which does not resolve correctly before the view is in a window hierarchy\n\n## [0.6.4] - 2026-02-20\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed crash when `onRefresh` is set on Mac Catalyst in Mac idiom — `UIRefreshControl` is now skipped when `behavioralStyle == .mac`, while apps using iPad idiom on Catalyst continue to get pull-to-refresh\n\n## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-20\n\n### Added\n\n- Comprehensive animated apply test suite (21 tests) covering section insert/delete/move/replace, item reorder and cross-section moves, non-structural reload/reconfigure fast path, structural changes with deferred reload/reconfigure markers, background diff with large datasets (≥1,000 items), and rapid-fire serialization edge cases\n- Deterministic cancellation tests verifying completion callback invocation and snapshot invariant safety when `applyTask` is cancelled mid-chain\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Completion handler `apply()` variant now supports cooperative cancellation and always invokes the completion callback (even when cancelled), preventing silent hangs for callers using `withCheckedContinuation`\n- `performBatchUpdates` completion handler now checks the `finished` parameter — deferred reloads/reconfigures are skipped when UIKit interrupts the batch update\n\n## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-19\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed `NSInternalInconsistencyException` crash when applying snapshots with only inserts (no deletes) using animated differences — `currentSnapshot` is now updated inside the `performBatchUpdates` closure so UIKit sees correct pre/post item counts\n\n### Added\n\n- Animated apply regression tests covering pure inserts, pure deletes, empty↔populated transitions, and mixed cross-section operations\n\n## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-18\n\n### Changed\n\n- `CollectionViewDiffableDataSource.performApply()` now offloads diff computation to a background thread for snapshots with ≥1,000 items, keeping the main thread free during large dataset updates\n\n### Added\n\n- Realistic UUID-based benchmarks comparing ListKit vs Apple using the `Item.ID` pattern with `Identifiable` model types\n- Mixed operations benchmarks testing inserts + deletes + moves simultaneously across ListKit, Apple, and IGListKit\n- Data source `apply()` benchmarks measuring the full end-to-end pipeline (diff + `performBatchUpdates`) for ListKit vs Apple\n\n### Fixed\n\n- `speedup()` benchmark helper now correctly handles durations >= 1 second (previously ignored the `seconds` component)\n\n## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-16\n\n### Added\n\n- **Snapshot `Equatable` conformance**: `DiffableDataSourceSnapshot` now conforms to `Equatable`, comparing section identifiers and item arrays while ignoring transient reload/reconfigure markers.\n- **Snapshot `init(sections:)` convenience initializer**: Build snapshots from `[(SectionID, [ItemID])]` pairs in a single call.\n- **`sectionIdentifier(at:)` on `DiffableDataSourceSnapshot`**: Index-based section lookup, complementing the existing `index(ofSection:)`.\n- **`replaceItems(in:with:)` on `DiffableDataSourceSnapshot`**: Bulk-replace all items in a section without deleting/re-appending the section.\n- **`removeItems(where:)` on `DiffableDataSourceSnapshot`**: Remove items matching a predicate across all sections, following `removeAll(where:)` convention.\n- **`children(of:)` on `DiffableDataSourceSectionSnapshot`**: Returns direct children of a given item, complementing the existing `parent(of:)`.\n- **Programmatic selection**: `selectItem(_:at:animated:)`, `deselectItem(_:animated:)`, and `isSelected(_:)` on `SimpleList`, `GroupedList`, and `OutlineList`.\n- **`shouldSelect` handler**: Closure on all three configurations (+ SwiftUI modifiers) that gates item selection via the `collectionView(_:shouldSelectItemAt:)` delegate.\n- **`backgroundView` property**: Auto-visibility empty-state view on all three configurations (+ SwiftUI modifiers), shown when the list is empty and hidden when it has content.\n- **`canMoveItemProvider`**: Per-item reorder predicate on `SimpleList` and `GroupedList` (+ SwiftUI modifiers).\n- **`scrollToTop` / `scrollToBottom`**: Convenience scroll methods on all three configurations.\n- **OutlineList tree queries**: `allItems`, `visibleItems`, `rootItems`, `parent(of:)`, and `level(of:)` for inspecting the outline hierarchy.\n- **`SimpleList.items`**: Convenience accessor for the current items in the list.\n- **Snapshot type aliases**: `SimpleList.Snapshot`, `GroupedList.Snapshot`, `OutlineList.Snapshot` for ergonomic snapshot type references.\n- **`MixedSection` header/footer support**: Optional `header` and `footer` parameters on `MixedSection`, wired through `MixedListDataSource.apply(content:)` with `headerForSection(_:)`/`footerForSection(_:)` accessors and a `configureListHeaderFooterProvider()` convenience method for automatic supplementary view rendering.\n- **`MixedListDataSource` reorder support**: `canMoveItemHandler` and `didMoveItemHandler` properties for drag-and-drop reordering parity with `ListDataSource`.\n- **Section query methods on `GroupedList`**: `sectionIdentifier(for:)`, `index(for:)`, and `items(in:)` for section-level navigation.\n- **`OutlineList` programmatic expand/collapse**: `expand(_:animated:)`, `collapse(_:animated:)`, and `isExpanded(_:)` methods for controlling outline hierarchy without rebuilding the tree.\n- **`onMove` SwiftUI modifier**: `.onMove()` modifier on `SimpleListView` and `GroupedListView` for drag-and-drop reordering, completing the SwiftUI wrapper API.\n- **Convenience query properties**: `numberOfItems`, `numberOfSections`, `selectedItems`, and `deselectAll(animated:)` on all three configurations (`SimpleList`, `GroupedList`, `OutlineList`).\n- **`SectionModel.mapItems(_:)`**: Transforms items within a section while preserving metadata, matching `OutlineItem.mapItems(_:)` for API consistency.\n- **`SectionModel` `Identifiable` conformance**: Enables direct use in SwiftUI `ForEach` and other `Identifiable`-requiring contexts.\n- **`OutlineItem` `Identifiable` conformance**: Uses `item` as identity, enabling direct use in SwiftUI contexts.\n\n## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-16\n\n### Added\n\n- **UIKit chat examples**: Two new UIKit counterparts to the existing SwiftUI chat example — `ListsChatExampleViewController` (`SimpleList` + `CellViewModel` + `UIHostingConfiguration`) and `ListKitChatExampleViewController` (raw `CollectionViewDiffableDataSource` with pure UIKit cells and manual cell reconfiguration).\n- **Shared chat input bar**: Reusable `ChatInputBar` UIKit view with keyboard layout guide support.\n- **`ListCellViewModel` protocol**: Convenience refinement of `CellViewModel` that defaults `Cell` to `UICollectionViewListCell`, eliminating the most common boilerplate `typealias`.\n- **`UICollectionViewListCell.setListContent()` helpers**: Two convenience methods (parameter-based and closure-based) that replace the repetitive 4-line content configuration pattern with a single call.\n- **SwiftUI-style view modifiers**: Chainable `.onSelect`, `.onDelete`, `.onRefresh`, `.editing`, `.contextMenu`, `.trailingSwipeActions`, `.leadingSwipeActions`, and more on `SimpleListView`, `GroupedListView`, and `OutlineListView`. Replaces the 19+ parameter initializer with an idiomatic init-then-modify pattern.\n- **Pull-to-refresh on UIKit configurations**: `onRefresh` property on `SimpleList`, `GroupedList`, and `OutlineList` with proper async task lifecycle management, bringing parity with the SwiftUI wrappers.\n- **`ContentEquatable` protocol**: Opt-in protocol for detecting content changes in identity-based view models. Automatically marks items for reconfiguration when content differs, solving the stale-UI footgun with `Identifiable` types.\n- **`OutlineItemBuilder` result builder**: Declarative trailing-closure syntax for constructing `OutlineItem` hierarchies with full support for conditionals, loops, and arrays.\n- **`SectionModel` `@ItemsBuilder` initializer**: Declarative builder-based section construction constrained to `CellViewModel` items.\n- **`SnapshotSection` header/footer support**: `header` and `footer` optional parameters in the `SnapshotBuilder` DSL, wired through to `GroupedList.setSections`.\n- **`Snapshot.contains(_:)` and `contains(section:)`**: Convenience queries using the reverse map for O(1) lookups when available.\n\n### Changed\n\n- **BREAKING: SwiftUI view initializers simplified**: `SimpleListView`, `GroupedListView`, and `OutlineListView` CellViewModel-based initializers now accept only layout/structural parameters. Behavioral properties (`onSelect`, `onDelete`, `onRefresh`, `editing`, etc.) must be set via the new chainable modifiers. Inline content initializers retain item-typed behavioral params (e.g., `onSelect`, `onDelete`) since they perform `Data → Item` wrapping.\n- **Refresh control logic consolidated**: Extracted `RefreshControlManager` to replace triplicated refresh control code across `SimpleList`, `GroupedList`, and `OutlineList`.\n- **Example app updated**: All UIKit examples use `ListCellViewModel` and `setListContent()`. `OutlineExampleViewController` uses builder DSL. `SwiftUIWrappersExampleView` demonstrates modifier-based configuration. `LiveExampleViewController` uses `ContentEquatable` for automatic reconfiguration.\n- **Example app: expanded feature coverage**: DSL example uses `GroupedList` with `SnapshotSection` header/footer DSL and `Snapshot.contains(section:)`. GroupedList example demonstrates `@ItemsBuilder`, `ListAccessory.toggle`, `.progress`, and `.activityIndicator`. All three UIKit examples include pull-to-refresh. SwiftUI `GroupedDemoView` demonstrates `.editing` and `.allowsMultipleSelection` modifiers.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- **Chat example separators**: Added explicit `separatorHandler` to `ListsChatExampleViewController` to ensure separators are fully hidden, preventing `itemSeparatorHandler` from overriding `showsSeparators: false`.\n- **Cell reuse accessory leak**: `setListContent()` now unconditionally assigns accessories, preventing stale accessories from persisting across cell reuse.\n- **`ListAccessory.progress` crash**: Replaced `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false` (which violates `UICellAccessory.customView` requirements) with `reservedLayoutWidth: .custom(60)`.\n\n## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-15\n\n### Added\n\n- **`ListAccessory.toggle`**: Inline `UISwitch` accessory for settings screens with `isOn` binding and `onChange` callback.\n- **`ListAccessory.badge`**: Pill-shaped count/status badge via `BadgeLabel` subclass with tint color propagation.\n- **`ListAccessory.image`**: SF Symbol trailing icon accessory with debug assertions for invalid symbol names.\n- **`ListAccessory.progress`**: Small inline progress bar (60pt width) with out-of-range value assertions.\n- **`ListAccessory.activityIndicator`**: Spinning indicator accessory for loading states.\n\n### Changed\n\n- **`ListAccessory.uiAccessory`** is now `@MainActor`-isolated for UIKit thread safety.\n\n## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-15\n\n### Added\n\n- **Scroll view delegate forwarding**: `SimpleList`, `GroupedList`, and `OutlineList` now forward `UIScrollViewDelegate` callbacks so consumers can receive scroll events without replacing the collection view's delegate.\n- **`collectionViewHandler` and `scrollViewDelegate` parameters** added to `GroupedListView` and `OutlineListView` for API parity with `SimpleListView`.\n- **`selfSizingInvalidation` parameter** on `SimpleList` and `SimpleListView` for controlling cell resize behavior during streaming content.\n- **Chat example**: New `ChatExampleView` demonstrating streaming chat with manual layout invalidation, scroll-to-bottom tracking, and bubble-scoped context menus.\n\n## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15\n\n### Added\n\n- **`onDelete` callback**: Automatic trailing swipe action generation for item deletion across all list configurations.\n- **`onMove` with drag-and-drop reorder**: Full drag-and-drop reorder infrastructure on `SimpleList` and `GroupedList` with `canMoveItemHandler` and `didMoveItemHandler` callbacks.\n- **`onDeselect` callback**: Multi-selection deselection support forwarded through all SwiftUI wrappers.\n- **`showsSeparators` parameter**: Native UIKit separator visibility toggle on all list configurations and `LayoutHelpers` factory methods.\n- **`ListAccessory.label`**: Text label accessory case.\n- **`ListAccessory.detail`**: Detail accessory with optional action handler.\n- **`ListAccessory.multiselect`**: Multi-selection checkmark accessory.\n- **`ListAccessory.popUpMenu`**: Pop-up menu accessory.\n- **UICollectionLayoutListConfiguration support**: `separatorColor`, `backgroundColor`, `headerTopPadding` across all list types with `separatorHandler` for per-item separator customization.\n- **Header/footer configuration**: `headerMode`/`footerMode` and `headerContentProvider`/`footerContentProvider` on `GroupedList`.\n- **Selection APIs**: `allowsMultipleSelection`, `allowsSelectionDuringEditing`, `allowsMultipleSelectionDuringEditing`, and `isEditing` computed property on all list types.\n- **Navigation APIs**: `itemIdentifier(for:)`, `indexPath(for:)`, and `scrollToItem(_:)` on all list configurations.\n- **`GroupedList.setSections` with `SnapshotBuilder` DSL** for declarative section updates.\n- **`ListLayout` factory methods** for all compositional layout appearance styles.\n- **`dismantleUIView`** added to all SwiftUI wrappers for deterministic cleanup.\n- **`buildLimitedAvailability`** added to all four result builders.\n- **`withTaskCancellationHandler`** support to propagate cancellation from structured parent tasks during SwiftUI coordinator teardown.\n\n### Changed\n\n- **`SectionModel` `Item` constraint** relaxed to `Hashable & Sendable`, fixing inline-content convenience initializers for plain data types.\n- **`SwipeActionBridge` renamed to `ListConfigurationBridge`**: Centralizes shared delegate logic, item navigation, and scroll-to-item into a single bridge to eliminate duplication across list types.\n- **Rapid-render coalescing**: New updates now cancel previous pending applies for faster UI convergence.\n- **UIKit layout closures** wrapped in `MainActor.assumeIsolated` for Swift 6 strict concurrency readiness.\n- **`OutlineList.setItems`** now uses native section snapshot apply instead of flat snapshot rebuild, enabling UIKit's optimized subtree diffing and native expand/collapse animations.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- **Section snapshot parent map corruption**: Fixed `snapshot(of:includingParent:)` where dangling parent references were copied for extracted subtrees.\n- **Multi-selection**: Guard `deselectItem` behind `!allowsMultipleSelection` so multi-selection workflows function correctly.\n- **Snapshot/UI mismatch**: Serialized `applySnapshotUsingReloadData` through the apply task chain to prevent interleaving with animated applies.\n- **Stale snapshot on deallocation**: Always update `currentSnapshot` before the `guard` when `collectionView` is deallocated.\n- **GroupedList header/footer atomicity**: Use merge-then-trim pattern during animated transitions.\n- **Snapshot data loss in move operation**: Validate destination section bounds before deleting item in `moveItemAt`.\n- **`deinit` task cancellation** added to `SimpleList`, `GroupedList`, and `OutlineList` to cancel lingering tasks on deallocation.\n- **Refresh control cleanup**: Use `defer` in `handleRefresh` to ensure `refreshTask` cleanup and spinner dismissal run on all exit paths.\n\n### Performance\n\n- **LIS-based minimal move detection**: Replaced naive diff move detection with longest-increasing-subsequence algorithm using O(n log n) patience sorting, eliminating unnecessary batch update animations.\n\n## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-13\n\n### Added\n\n- **SwiftUI wrappers**: `SimpleListView`, `GroupedListView`, and `OutlineListView` — `UIViewRepresentable` wrappers driven by `@State`.\n- **Inline content API**: `@ViewBuilder` convenience initializers on all three SwiftUI wrappers. Define cell content inline without creating a dedicated `CellViewModel` type.\n- **`SwiftUICellViewModel` protocol**: Protocol for reusable SwiftUI-based cell view models with `body` and `accessories`.\n- **`InlineCellViewModel`**: Type-erased `CellViewModel` backing the inline content API.\n- **`ListAccessory`**: Pure-Swift enum wrapping `UICellAccessory` with a `.custom` escape hatch.\n- **Swipe actions**: Leading and trailing swipe action support on all three list configurations and their SwiftUI wrappers.\n- **Context menus**: Context menu support on all three list configurations and their SwiftUI wrappers.\n- **Pull-to-refresh**: `onRefresh` async closure on all three SwiftUI wrappers with automatic `UIRefreshControl` lifecycle management.\n- **`OutlineItem.mapItems`**: Recursive tree transformation for mapping data types across outline hierarchies.\n- **`OutlineItem` `Equatable` conformance**: Enables diffing in SwiftUI `updateUIView`.\n\n### Changed\n\n- **`OutlineItem` generic constraint** relaxed from `CellViewModel` to `Hashable & Sendable`, enabling use with plain data types.\n- **`SwiftUICellViewModel.accessories`** return type changed from `[UICellAccessory]` to `[ListAccessory]`.\n- **Task serialization** added to `SimpleList.setItems`, `GroupedList.setSections`, and `OutlineList.setItems` to prevent concurrent snapshot applies.\n- **Supplementary view bounds checking** added to `GroupedList` header/footer registration.\n\n## [0.0.1] - 2025-12-20\n\nInitial development release.\n\n### Added\n\n- **ListKit**: O(n) Heckel diff engine, `DiffableDataSourceSnapshot`, `DiffableDataSourceSectionSnapshot`, `CollectionViewDiffableDataSource`.\n- **Lists**: `CellViewModel` protocol, `ListDataSource`, `MixedListDataSource`, `AnyItem`, result-builder DSL (`SnapshotBuilder`, `ItemsBuilder`, `MixedSnapshotBuilder`), `SimpleList`, `GroupedList`, `OutlineList` configurations, layout helpers.\n- Swift 6 strict concurrency support.\n- MIT license.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":14,"oldLines":6,"newStart":14,"newLines":8,"lines":[" ### Changed"," "," - Extracted shared `computeItemsToReconfigure` function from `ListDataSource` and `MixedListDataSource`, deduplicating the autoReconfigure algorithm","+- Extracted shared `flattenSectionSnapshot` function from `ListDataSource` and `MixedListDataSource`, deduplicating the section snapshot flattening logic","+- Removed dead convenience methods from `ListConfigurationBridge` (`scrollToItem`, `selectItem`, `deselectItem`, `isSelected`, `scrollToTop`, `scrollToBottom`) — now provided by `ListConfigurable` protocol extension"," "," ### Fixed"," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"464b2f99-09af-4deb-8fad-00ba81221bf0"}

The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation:\n\n1. **Initial Request**: The user invoked `/deep-review` skill, which triggers a comprehensive code review of the current PR branch `Iron-Ham/fix-outline-content-reconfigure`.\n\n2. **Scope Detection Phase**: I determined the PR scope:\n   - Branch: `Iron-Ham/fix-outline-content-reconfigure`\n   - 1 commit: `refactor: deduplicate autoReconfigure and list configuration APIs`\n   - 10 source files changed (8 Swift, 1 CHANGELOG.md, 1 AGENTS.md)\n   - Platform detection: iOS (UICollectionView framework)\n   - Aspects: `core` (code + errors + arch) + `ios` platform = 8 agents\n\n3. **Review Team Phase**: Created a team with 8 agents:\n   - code-reviewer (opus)\n   - silent-failure-hunter\n   - dependency-mapper\n   - cycle-detector\n   - hotspot-analyzer\n   - pattern-scout\n   - scale-assessor\n   - ios-platform-reviewer\n   \n   All agents completed successfully and a synthesizer compiled the report.\n\n4. **Review Findings** (from REPORT.md):\n   - NEW Issues: 0 critical, 2 important\n     1. Section snapshot apply flattens hierarchy (ListDataSource.swift:99-116)\n     2. Dead code in ListConfigurationBridge (lines 135-213)\n   - Suggestions: 4 items\n     3. computeItemsToReconfigure lacks explicit access control\n     4. Redundant snapshot() calls in numberOfItems/numberOfSections\n     5. scrollToBottom doesn't account for pre-layout state\n     6. Section snapshot flattening logic duplicated between data sources\n   - PRE-EXISTING Issues: 0 critical, 3 important\n     1. UIScrollViewDelegate forwarding duplicated across 3 configs (~120 lines)\n     2. Bridge initialization ceremony is fragile\n     3. Closure callbacks risk retain cycles without documentation\n\n5. **User's Second Request**: \"Fix all pre-existing issues, fix all new issues.\"\n\n6. **Implementation Phase**: I read all relevant files and made the following fixes:\n\n   **Fix 1**: Removed 6 dead bridge methods from ListConfigurationBridge.swift:\n   - `scrollToItem`, `selectItem`, `deselectItem`, `isSelected`, `scrollToTop`, `scrollToBottom`\n   - First verified no callers exist with grep\n\n   **Fix 2**: Updated AutoReconfigure.swift:\n   - Changed ABOUTME comment to reflect broader scope\n   - Added `internal` keyword to `computeItemsToReconfigure` (later removed by SwiftFormat's `redundantInternal` rule)\n   - Added new `flattenSectionSnapshot` free function\n\n   **Fix 3**: Updated ListConfigurable.swift:\n   - Changed `numberOfItems` to use `collectionView.numberOfItems(inSection:)` instead of `snapshot().numberOfItems`\n   - Changed `numberOfSections` to use `collectionView.numberOfSections` instead of `snapshot().numberOfSections`\n   - Added pre-layout behavior doc note to `scrollToBottom`\n\n   **Fix 4**: Updated ListDataSource.swift:\n   - Replaced inline section snapshot flattening with call to shared `flattenSectionSnapshot`\n\n   **Fix 5**: Updated MixedListDataSource.swift:\n   - Same as Fix 4\n\n   **Fix 6**: Added \"Closure Callbacks\" doc section to SimpleList, GroupedList, OutlineList class-level doc comments warning about retain cycles\n\n   **Fix 7**: Added comments explaining @objc UIScrollViewDelegate duplication in all 3 configuration classes\n\n   **Fix 8**: Updated CHANGELOG.md with new entries\n\n7. **Errors encountered**:\n   - Multiple \"File has not been read yet\" errors when trying to edit files I hadn't read in the current context window (SimpleList.swift, GroupedList.swift, OutlineList.swift, ListDataSource.swift). Fixed by reading the files first.\n   - SwiftFormat removed the explicit `internal` keyword from `computeItemsToReconfigure` due to the project's `redundantInternal` rule - this is correct behavior, not an error.\n   - SwiftFormat reformatted `// MARK:` comments to regular comments - also correct per project conventions.\n\n8. **Verification**:\n   - `make format` passed (4/85 files formatted)\n   - `make build` succeeded\n   - `make test` succeeded (304 tests pass)\n   - Amended the existing commit per the one-commit-per-branch workflow\n\n9. **What was NOT fixed** (and why):\n   - UIScrollViewDelegate duplication: Cannot be eliminated due to @objc/protocol-extension limitation. Documented with comments instead.\n   - Bridge initialization ceremony: Already has runtime safety (assertionFailure in swipe actions, optional chaining elsewhere). No practical compile-time enforcement possible without major restructuring.\n   - Section snapshot flattening (NEW issue #1): Verified as intentional design. OutlineList maintains hierarchy via `currentSectionSnapshot` while the flat apply path is correct for display.\n\nThe user's task appears complete - all changes are committed.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - The user invoked `/deep-review` (the deep-review skill) to run a comprehensive code review on the current PR branch `Iron-Ham/fix-outline-content-reconfigure`.\n   - After receiving the review report, the user explicitly requested: \"Fix all pre-existing issues, fix all new issues.\"\n   - This encompassed 2 new important issues, 4 suggestions, and 3 pre-existing important issues identified by the 8-agent review team.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **ListKit**: A high-performance UICollectionView framework with two Swift modules (ListKit for diffing, Lists for high-level API)\n   - **ListConfigurable protocol**: New protocol providing ~15 default implementations from 4 requirements (collectionView, snapshot(), itemIdentifier(for:), indexPath(for:))\n   - **Protocol extension @objc limitation**: Swift protocol extensions cannot provide `@objc` method implementations because Objective-C dispatch uses the class vtable, not Swift's witness table. UIScrollViewDelegate methods must remain duplicated on each NSObject subclass.\n   - **\"Pure function with closure\" pattern**: Free functions like `computeItemsToReconfigure` and `flattenSectionSnapshot` operating on value-type snapshots with closure parameters for strategy injection\n   - **One-commit-per-branch workflow**: Each branch contains exactly one commit; subsequent changes amend the existing commit\n   - **SwiftFormat rules**: Project uses `redundantInternal` rule (strips explicit `internal` keywords) and `organizeDeclarations`\n   - **Task serialization with `applyTask` chain**: Pattern for preventing interleaved async applies on @MainActor\n   - **Section snapshot flattening**: Converting hierarchical DiffableDataSourceSectionSnapshot to flat DiffableDataSourceSnapshot using visibleItems\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`Sources/Lists/Configurations/ListConfigurationBridge.swift`**\n     - Central bridge resolving IndexPath-to-Item for layout config handlers\n     - Removed 6 dead methods (~80 lines): `scrollToItem`, `selectItem`, `deselectItem`, `isSelected`, `scrollToTop`, `scrollToBottom` — superseded by ListConfigurable protocol extension\n     - Verified zero callers with grep before removal\n\n   - **`Sources/Lists/DataSource/AutoReconfigure.swift`**\n     - Shared data source algorithms file\n     - Updated ABOUTME to: `// ABOUTME: Shared data source algorithms for content-change detection and section snapshot flattening.`\n     - Added new `flattenSectionSnapshot` free function:\n     ```swift\n     func flattenSectionSnapshot<SectionID: Hashable & Sendable, Item: Hashable & Sendable>(\n       _ sectionSnapshot: DiffableDataSourceSectionSnapshot<Item>,\n       intoSection section: SectionID,\n       of snapshot: DiffableDataSourceSnapshot<SectionID, Item>\n     ) -> DiffableDataSourceSnapshot<SectionID, Item>? {\n       var newSnapshot = snapshot\n       guard newSnapshot.sectionIdentifiers.contains(section) else {\n         assertionFailure(\"Cannot apply section snapshot to non-existent section \\(section)\")\n         return nil\n       }\n       let oldItems = newSnapshot.itemIdentifiers(inSection: section)\n       newSnapshot.deleteItems(oldItems)\n       let visibleItems = sectionSnapshot.visibleItems\n       if !visibleItems.isEmpty {\n         newSnapshot.appendItems(visibleItems, toSection: section)\n       }\n       return newSnapshot\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`Sources/Lists/Protocols/ListConfigurable.swift`**\n     - Changed `numberOfItems` and `numberOfSections` to avoid unnecessary snapshot copies:\n     ```swift\n     public var numberOfItems: Int {\n       (0..<collectionView.numberOfSections).reduce(0) { $0 + collectionView.numberOfItems(inSection: $1) }\n     }\n     public var numberOfSections: Int {\n       collectionView.numberOfSections\n     }\n     ```\n     - Added pre-layout doc note to `scrollToBottom`:\n     ```swift\n     /// - Note: This method reads `contentSize` and `bounds`, which are zero before the\n     ///   collection view has performed layout. Call after the view appears or after\n     ///   `layoutIfNeeded()` to ensure correct behavior.\n     ```\n\n   - **`Sources/Lists/DataSource/ListDataSource.swift`**\n     - Replaced 15-line inline section snapshot flattening with shared helper:\n     ```swift\n     public func apply(\n       _ sectionSnapshot: DiffableDataSourceSectionSnapshot<Item>,\n       to section: SectionID,\n       animatingDifferences: Bool = true\n     ) async {\n       guard let newSnapshot = flattenSectionSnapshot(sectionSnapshot, intoSection: section, of: dataSource.snapshot()) else {\n         return\n       }\n       await apply(newSnapshot, animatingDifferences: animatingDifferences)\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`Sources/Lists/DataSource/MixedListDataSource.swift`**\n     - Same deduplication as ListDataSource — replaced identical inline flattening with `flattenSectionSnapshot` call\n\n   - **`Sources/Lists/Configurations/SimpleList.swift`**\n     - Added \"Closure Callbacks\" section to class doc comment warning about retain cycles with `[weak self]`\n     - Added comment explaining @objc UIScrollViewDelegate forwarding duplication\n\n   - **`Sources/Lists/Configurations/GroupedList.swift`**\n     - Same doc comment additions as SimpleList\n\n   - **`Sources/Lists/Configurations/OutlineList.swift`**\n     - Same doc comment additions as SimpleList\n\n   - **`CHANGELOG.md`**\n     - Added 2 entries under `### Changed`:\n       - Extracted shared `flattenSectionSnapshot` function\n       - Removed dead convenience methods from `ListConfigurationBridge`\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **\"File has not been read yet\" errors** on SimpleList.swift, GroupedList.swift, OutlineList.swift, ListDataSource.swift, ListConfigurable.swift:\n     - Fixed by reading each file before attempting edits\n   - **SwiftFormat removed `internal` keyword** from `computeItemsToReconfigure`:\n     - Project's `.swiftformat` has `--rules redundantInternal` which strips explicit `internal` (the default access level). This is correct behavior — the suggestion to add explicit `internal` conflicts with project formatting rules.\n   - **SwiftFormat reformatted `// MARK:` comments**: The `// MARK: UIScrollViewDelegate Forwarding` headers were reformatted to regular comments (without MARK: prefix). This is consistent with project conventions.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **Dead code verification**: Used `grep` to confirm zero callers of bridge methods before removing them\n   - **Section snapshot flattening (NEW issue #1)**: Verified as intentional design — OutlineList maintains hierarchy via `currentSectionSnapshot` while using flat apply for display. Doc comment already documents this.\n   - **UIScrollViewDelegate duplication (PRE-EXISTING #1)**: Cannot be eliminated due to fundamental Swift @objc/protocol-extension limitation. Addressed with explanatory comments instead.\n   - **Bridge initialization fragility (PRE-EXISTING #2)**: Already has runtime safety (assertionFailure guards). No practical compile-time enforcement possible without major restructuring. Left as-is since all 3 callers are correct.\n   - **Build + test verification**: `make build` succeeded, `make test` passed all 304 tests\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - (Initial implicit message invoking `/deep-review` skill via `<command-name>/deep-review:deep-review</command-name>`)\n   - \"Fix all pre-existing issues, fix all new issues.\"\n   \n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - No explicit pending tasks. The docs may need regeneration (`make docs`) since public API doc comments changed (scrollToBottom, class-level docs), but this was already handled by the original commit's doc generation.\n\n8. Current Work:\n   All fixes have been completed and committed. The commit was amended (per one-commit-per-branch workflow) with message:\n   ```\n   refactor: deduplicate autoReconfigure and list configuration APIs\n   ```\n   The amended commit includes all original changes plus:\n   - Dead bridge method removal (-67 lines from ListConfigurationBridge)\n   - flattenSectionSnapshot shared helper (+30 lines in AutoReconfigure.swift)\n   - Section snapshot flattening deduplication in both data sources (-14 lines each)\n   - numberOfItems/numberOfSections optimization in ListConfigurable\n   - scrollToBottom doc note\n   - Retain cycle doc guidance on 3 config classes\n   - @objc duplication explanation comments on 3 config classes\n   - CHANGELOG updates\n   \n   Net change: -29 lines. Build succeeds, all 304 tests pass.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   The user may want to run `make docs` and include the updated `docs/` output since public API doc comments changed (scrollToBottom note, class-level closure callback docs). The CLAUDE.md instructions state: \"You MUST run `make docs` and commit the updated `docs/` output when... Doc comments (`///`) on public symbols\" change. However, since the original commit already included generated docs and the doc changes are minor additions, this should be confirmed with the user. The user may also want to force-push the amended commit to the remote branch.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/zer0/.REDACTED.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions.

These must be addressed before merge.\n- **[PRE-EXISTING]**: Issues in code **not changed** by this PR. These are technical debt observations that should not block the PR but are valuable to track.\n\nThis distinction helps reviewers focus on what's actionable for the current PR while still surfacing important context about surrounding code quality.\n\n## Scope Detection\n\nDetermine the analysis scope from flags or arguments:\n\n1. **If `--pr` or `--branch` flag provided**:\n   - Detect base branch: check for `main`, then `master`, or use `git merge-base`\n   - Run `git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD` to get all files changed in this branch\n   - Analyze those files and their immediate dependencies\n\n2. **If `--changes` flag provided**:\n   - Run `git diff --name-only HEAD` and `git diff --name-only --cached` for uncommitted changes\n   - Analyze those files and their immediate dependencies\n\n3. **If path argument provided** (e.g., `/deep-review src/features`):\n   - Analyze only that path\n\n4. **If no arguments**:\n   - Default to `--pr` behavior (analyze current branch changes)\n\n## Review Aspects\n\nSelect which aspects to review. Default is `core` (code + errors + arch).\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `code` | CLAUDE.md compliance, bugs, code quality |\n| `errors` | Silent failures, catch blocks, error handling |\n| `arch` | Dependencies, cycles, hotspots, patterns, scale |\n| `types` | Type invariants, encapsulation, design quality |\n| `comments` | Comment accuracy, rot, maintainability |\n| `tests` | Test coverage, quality, critical gaps |\n| `simplify` | Code clarity, refactoring opportunities |\n| `a11y` | WCAG compliance, ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers |\n| `l10n` | Hardcoded strings, i18n readiness, locale handling, RTL |\n| `concurrency` | Race conditions, deadlocks, thread safety, async pitfalls |\n| `perf` | Algorithmic complexity, allocations, caching, rendering, N+1 queries |\n| `core` | code + errors + arch (default) |\n| `full` | All cross-cutting aspects (does not include platform-specific) |\n\n**Platform-specific aspects** (automatically included when relevant, or explicitly requested):\n\n| Aspect | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `ios` | Swift/SwiftUI/UIKit lifecycle, ARC, Apple APIs, App Store compliance |\n| `android` | Activity/Fragment lifecycle, Compose, manifest, Android security |\n| `ts-frontend` | React/Vue/Angular state, SSR/hydration, component patterns, browser APIs |\n| `ts-backend` | Node.js event loop, middleware, ORM, auth, graceful shutdown, API design |\n| `python` | Pythonic idioms, type hints, Django/FastAPI/Flask, packaging |\n| `rust` | Ownership idioms, unsafe auditing, error handling, trait design |\n| `go` | Go idioms, interface design, context propagation, module hygiene |\n| `rails` | Rails conventions, ActiveRecord, migration safety, background jobs |\n| `flutter` | Widget design, state management, Dart idioms, platform channels |\n| `java` | Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, bean lifecycle, enterprise patterns |\n| `dotnet` | ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, LINQ, C# idioms |\n| `php` | Laravel, Composer, Eloquent, Blade, PHP 8+ features |\n| `cpp` | Modern C++ (11/14/17/20), memory safety, RAII, STL, templates |\n| `react-native` | Bridge perf, native modules, platform-specific code paths |\n| `svelte` | Svelte reactivity, SvelteKit routing, compile-time patterns |\n| `elixir` | OTP/GenServer, Phoenix LiveView, BEAM concurrency |\n| `kotlin-server` | Ktor, coroutines, Kotlin idioms for server-side |\n| `scala` | Functional patterns, Akka/Spark, implicits, effect systems |\n| `macos` | AppKit, SwiftUI for macOS, sandboxing, XPC, notarization, desktop integration |\n| `nextjs` | Server/Client Components, App Router, caching, Server Actions, middleware |\n| `vue` | Vue 3 Composition API, Nuxt 3, Pinia, reactivity patterns, template syntax |\n| `django` | Django ORM, DRF, migrations, template security, middleware, signals |\n| `ruby` | Ruby idioms, metaprogramming safety, gem hygiene, RSpec/Minitest patterns |\n| `terraform` | HCL, state management, IAM security, module design, blast radius control |\n| `shell` | Bash/POSIX sh quoting, error handling, portability, CI/CD script safety |\n| `angular` | Angular DI, RxJS, change detection, signals, template safety |\n| `docker` | Dockerfile layers, multi-stage builds, security, PID 1, Compose |\n| `kubernetes` | K8s manifests, resource limits, security contexts, RBAC, probes, Helm |\n| `graphql` | Schema design, resolver N+1, query security, authorization, DataLoader |\n| `github-actions` | Workflow security, secret handling, action pinning, runner config |\n| `mobile` | ios + android |\n| `ts` | ts-frontend + ts-backend |\n| `jvm` | java + kotlin-server + scala |\n| `apple` | ios + macos |\n| `infra` | terraform + shell |\n| `containers` | docker + kubernetes |\n\nPlatform reviewers are **automatically included** when the team lead determines they are relevant based on the changed files and project context. For example, changing `.swift` files in an iOS project will include the iOS reviewer. The team lead uses its judgment to disambiguate — `.swift` in a macOS project triggers macOS (not iOS), `.kt` in a Ktor server won't trigger Android, `.py` in a Django project triggers django (not just python), `.vue` files trigger vue (not ts-frontend), Next.js projects trigger nextjs (not just ts-frontend). Users can also explicitly request platform aspects (e.g., `/deep-review ios`). Platform aspects are never included in `core` or `full` unless detected or explicitly requested.\n\n**Usage examples:**\n```\n/deep-review                    # core review of PR changes (+ auto-detected platforms)\n/deep-review --pr               #

Parse arguments to extract:\n   - Scope flag: `--pr`, `--branch`, `--changes`, or path\n   - Aspects: list of aspects or `core`/`full`\n\n2. Get changed files based on scope:\n   ```bash\n   # For --pr/--branch (detect base branch first)\n   BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null || echo \"HEAD~10\")\n   git diff --name-only $BASE...HEAD\n\n   # For --changes\n   git diff --name-only HEAD\n   git diff --name-only --cached\n   ```\n\n3. **Get detailed diff with line numbers** (for distinguishing new vs pre-existing issues):\n   ```bash\n   # Get the unified diff showing which lines were added/modified\n   git diff $BASE...HEAD --unified=0 | grep -E '^@@|^diff --git'\n   ```\n   This output shows the exact line ranges that were changed. Parse it to build a map of `{file: [changed_line_ranges]}`.\n\n4. Build the scope context string (referred to as `SCOPE_CONTEXT` below):\n   ```\n   SCOPE: Focus analysis on these files and their direct dependencies:\n   {list of changed files}\n\n   CHANGED LINE RANGES (for classifying issues):\n   {file1}: lines {start1}-{end1}, {start2}-{end2}, ...\n   {file2}: lines {start1}-{end1}, ...\n\n   IMPORTANT - Issue Classification:\n   When reporting issues, you MUST classify each issue as one of:\n   - **[NEW]**: Issue is in code that was ADDED or MODIFIED in this PR (within the changed line ranges above)\n   - **[PRE-EXISTING]**: Issue is in code that was NOT changed by this PR (outside the changed line ranges)\n\n   This distinction is critical for PR review. New issues should be fixed before merge.\n   Pre-existing issues are technical debt to track but should not block the PR.\n   ```\n\n### Phase 1.5: Determine Platform Reviewers\n\nAfter obtaining the list of changed files, determine which platform-specific reviewers to include. Available platform reviewers and what they cover:\n\n| Aspect | Covers |\n|--------|--------|\n| `ios` | Swift/SwiftUI/UIKit lifecycle, ARC, Apple APIs, App Store compliance |\n| `macos` | AppKit, SwiftUI for macOS, sandboxing, XPC, notarization, desktop integration |\n| `android` | Activity/Fragment lifecycle, Compose, manifest, Android security |\n| `ts-frontend` | React/Vue/Angular state, SSR/hydration, component patterns, browser APIs |\n| `ts-backend` | Node.js event loop, middleware, ORM, auth, graceful shutdown, API design |\n| `nextjs` | Server/Client Components, App Router, caching, Server Actions, middleware |\n| `vue` | Vue 3 Composition API, Nuxt 3, Pinia, reactivity patterns, template syntax |\n| `python` | Pythonic idioms, type hints, Django/FastAPI/Flask, packaging |\n| `django` | Django ORM, DRF, migrations, template security, middleware, signals |\n| `ruby` | Ruby idioms, metaprogramming safety, gem hygiene, RSpec/Minitest patterns |\n| `rust` | Ownership idioms, unsafe auditing, error handling, trait design |\n| `go` | Go idioms, interface design, context propagation, module hygiene |\n| `rails` | Rails conventions, ActiveRecord, migration safety, background jobs |\n| `flutter` | Widget design, state management, Dart idioms, platform channels |\n| `java` | Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, bean lifecycle, enterprise patterns |\n| `dotnet` | ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, LINQ, C# idioms |\n| `php` | Laravel, Composer, Eloquent, Blade, PHP 8+ features |\n| `cpp` | Modern C++ (11/14/17/20), memory safety, RAII, STL, templates |\n| `react-native` | Bridge perf, native modules, platform-specific code paths |\n| `svelte` | Svelte reactivity, SvelteKit routing, compile-time patterns |\n| `elixir` | OTP/GenServer, Phoenix LiveView, BEAM concurrency |\n| `kotlin-server` | Ktor, coroutines, Kotlin idioms for server-side |\n| `scala` | Functional patterns, Akka/Spark, implicits, effect systems |\n| `terraform` | HCL, state management, IAM security, module design, blast radius control |\n| `shell` | Bash/POSIX sh quoting, error handling, portability, CI/CD script safety |\n| `angular` | Angular DI, RxJS, change detection, signals, template safety |\n| `docker` | Dockerfile layers, multi-stage builds, security, PID 1, Compose |\n| `kubernetes` | K8s manifests, resource limits, security contexts, RBAC, probes, Helm |\n| `graphql` | Schema design, resolver N+1, query security, authorization, DataLoader |\n| `github-actions` | Workflow security, secret handling, action pinning, runner config |\n\n**If the user explicitly requested platform aspects** (e.g., `/deep-review ios`, `/deep-review python rust`), use those directly.\n\n**If the user did not request any platform aspects**, look at the changed files and the project context to decide which platform reviewers are relevant. Use your judgment — examine file extensions, imports, build files, and project structure to determine the right reviewers. Be precise: `.swift` files in a macOS project should trigger macOS (not iOS), `.kt` files in a Ktor server should not trigger Android, `.ts` files in an Express app should trigger `ts-backend` not `ts-frontend`, `.vue` files should trigger `vue` (not `ts-frontend`), projects with `next.config.*` should trigger `nextjs`, projects with Django's `settings.py`/`manage.py` should trigger `django`, `.tf` files should trigger `terraform`, `.sh`/`.bash` files should trigger `shell`, Angular projects (`angular.json`) should trigger `angular`, `Dockerfile`/`docker-compose.yml` should trigger `docker`, K8s manifests (YAML with `apiVersion`/`kind`) should trigger `kubernetes`, `.graphql`/`.gql` files or GraphQL schema definitions should trigger `graphql`, `.github/workflows/*.yml` files should trigger `github-actions`. When genuinely uncertain, skip rather than guess wrong — the user can always request a platform reviewer explicitly.\n\n**Group alias expansion**:\n- `mobile` → `ios`, `android`\n- `ts` → `ts-frontend`, `ts-backend`\n- `jvm` → `java`, `kotlin-server`, `scala`\n- `apple` → `ios`, `macos`\n- `infra` → `terraform`, `shell`\n- `containers` → `docker`, `kubernetes`\n\n**Merge behavior**:\n- Platform aspects are **added to** whatever cross-cutting aspects the user requested\n- Platform aspects are never included in `core` or `full` expansion — they only come from auto-detection or explicit request\n- Deduplicate: if auto-detection finds `ts-frontend` and the user also typed `ts`, only include `ts-frontend` once\n\n### Phase 2: Determine Which Agents to Launch\n\nBased on selected aspects (including any auto-detected platform aspects from Phase 1.5):\n\n| Aspect | Agents to Launch |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| `core` | Code Reviewer, Silent Failure Hunter, all 5 Architecture agents |\n| `full` | All agents below |\n| `code` | Code Reviewer |\n| `errors` | Silent Failure Hunter |\n| `arch` | Dependency Mapper, Cycle Detector, Hotspot Analyzer, Pattern Scout, Scale Assessor |\n| `types` | Type Design Analyzer |\n| `comments` | Comment Analyzer |\n| `tests` | Test Analyzer |\n| `simplify` | Code Simplifier |\n| `a11y` | Accessibility Scanner |\n| `l10n` | Localization Scanner |\n| `concurrency` | Concurrency Analyzer |\n| `perf` | Performance Analyzer |\n| `ios` | iOS Platform Reviewer |\n| `macos` | macOS Platform Reviewer |\n| `android` | Android Platform Reviewer |\n| `ts-frontend` | TypeScript Frontend Reviewer |\n| `ts-backend` | TypeScript Backend Reviewer |\n| `nextjs` | Next.js Reviewer |\n| `vue` | Vue.js Reviewer |\n| `python` | Python Reviewer |\n| `django` | Django Reviewer |\n| `ruby` | Ruby Reviewer |\n| `rust` | Rust Reviewer |\n| `go` | Go Reviewer |\n| `rails` | Rails Reviewer |\n| `flutter` | Flutter Reviewer |\n| `java` | Java Reviewer |\n| `dotnet` | .NET Reviewer |\n| `php` | PHP Reviewer |\n| `cpp` | C/C++ Reviewer |\n| `react-native` | React Native Reviewer |\n| `svelte` | Svelte Reviewer |\n| `elixir` | Elixir Reviewer |\n| `kotlin-server` | Kotlin Server Reviewer |\n| `scala` | Scala Reviewer |\n| `terraform` | Terraform Reviewer |\n| `shell` | Shell/Bash Reviewer |\n| `angular` | Angular Reviewer |\n| `docker` | Docker Reviewer |\n| `kubernetes` | Kubernetes Reviewer |\n| `graphql` | GraphQL Reviewer |\n| `github-actions` | GitHub Actions Reviewer |\n\n### Phase 3: Initialize Team and Launch Teammates\n\n1. **Create results directory**:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p /tmp/deep-review-$(uuidgen | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')/\n   ```\n   Store the path as `REVIEW_DIR`.\n\n2. **Create the team**:\n   Use `TeamCreate` with name `\"deep-review\"`.\n\n3. **Create tasks** for each selected agent:\n   Use `TaskCreate` for each agent with:\n   - Subject: `\"Run {agent-display-name} analysis\"`\n   - Description: includes the output file path `{REVIEW_DIR}/{agent-id}.md`\n\n4. **Spawn all analysis teammates in parallel**:\n   For each selected agent, use the Task tool:\n   - `subagent_type`: `\"general-purpose\"`\n   - `model`: from dispatch table (`opus` or omit for inherit)\n   - `team_name`: `\"deep-review\"`\n   - `name`: `\"{agent-id}\"` (e.g., `\"code-reviewer\"`, `\"cycle-detector\"`)\n   - `prompt`: use the Teammate Prompt Template below, filled in with the agent's details\n\n### Phase 4: Monitor Task Completion\n\n1. Wait for summary messages from all teammates (they will send a brief message via SendMessage when done)\n2. Verify via `TaskList` that all analysis tasks show `\"completed\"`\n3. For any tasks that did not complete, check if the output file exists anyway (partial findings are still valuable)\n4. Build a gap report string listing any agents that failed to produce output\n\n### Phase 5: Launch Synthesis Teammate\n\n1. **Create a synthesis task**:\n   Use `TaskCreate` with subject `\"Synthesize findings into unified report\"`.\n\n2. **Spawn the synthesis teammate**:\n   - `subagent_type`: `\"general-purpose\"`\n   - `team_name`: `\"deep-review\"`\n   - `name`: `\"synthesizer\"`\n   - `prompt`: Include the following in the prompt:\n     - Path to the synthesis instructions file: `agents/synthesizer.md`\n     - The `REVIEW_DIR` path\n     - The list of expected output files (one per agent that was launched)\n     - The gap report (if any agents failed)\n     - The scope description (for the report header)\n     - Instruction to write the final report to `{REVIEW_DIR}/REPORT.md`\n     - Instruction to mark the synthesis task as completed and send a message to `\"team-lead\"` when done\n\n3. Wait for the synthesis teammate to complete.\n\n### Phase 6: Present Report and Cleanup\n\n1. **Read the report**: Read `{REVIEW_DIR}/REPORT.md` and present its contents to the user\n2. **Shutdown teammates**: Send shutdown requests to all teammates\n3. **Clean up team**: Use `TeamDelete` to clean up team infrastructure\n4. **Inform the user**: Let them know individual agent findings are available at `{REVIEW_DIR}/` for detailed inspection\n\n## Teammate Prompt Template\n\nThis is the standardized prompt given to each analysis teammate. Fill in the placeholders before sending.\n\n```\nYou are a specialized code analysis agent on the \"deep-review\" team.\n\n## Your Task\n\n1. Read your analysis instructions from: {AGENT_FILE_PATH}\n   (This is relative to the skill directory. Use the Read tool to read the file.)\n2. Analyze the code following those instructions\n3. Write your complete findings to: {OUTPUT_FILE_PATH}\n4. Mark your task as completed via TaskUpdate (task ID: {TASK_ID})\n5. Send a brief summary to \"team-lead\" via SendMessage\n   - Include only counts (e.g., \"Found 3 critical, 2 important new issues; 5 pre-existing issues\")\n   - Do NOT include detailed findings in the message — they are in the output file\n\n## Scope Context\n\n{SCOPE_CONTEXT}\n\nNote: Your analysis instructions reference `{SCOPE_CONTEXT}`.\nThis refers to the Scope Context provided directly above — use it as-is.\n\n## Output File Format\n\nWrite your findings as a markdown file. Start with a heading identifying the agent,\nthen list all findings using the output format specified in your analysis instructions.\n\n## Classification Rules\n\nWhen classifying issues as [NEW] or [PRE-EXISTING], use the changed line ranges\nprovided in the Scope Context above. Issues in changed lines are [NEW]; all others\nare [PRE-EXISTING].\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf you encounter errors during analysis (e.g., files not found, permission issues):\n- Write partial findings to the output file along with an ERROR section describing what went wrong\n- Mark the task as completed anyway (so the pipeline is not blocked)\n- Note the error in your summary message to team-lead\n\n## Important\n\n- Do NOT modify any source code files — this is a READ-ONLY analysis\n- Write your findings ONLY to the output file path specified above\n- Be thorough but focused — quality over quantity\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n- Run `/deep-review --pr` before creating a PR to catch issues early\n- Use `core` (default) for quick essential checks\n- Use `full` for comprehensive review before major merges\n- **Focus on [NEW] issues** - these must be fixed before merge\n- **[PRE-EXISTING] issues** are technical debt to track, not PR blockers\n- Re-run after fixes to verify resolution\n- Use specific aspects (e.g., `types tests`) when you know the concern\n- Platform reviewers are automatically included when relevant — no need to specify them manually\n- Use `mobile`, `ts`, or explicit platform names (e.g., `ios`, `python`) to force specific platform reviewers\n- Create follow-up tickets for critical pre-existing issues discovered during review\n- Individual agent findings are available in `/tmp/deep-review-*/` for detailed inspection\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"0fb20fad-e077-4abc-bbab-24f45166fd28","timestamp":"2026-02-23T22:25:58.060Z"}

If a new delegate method is needed, all three files must be updated.\n\n#### `applyTask` serialization chain is a manual pattern, not enforced by the type system\n- **Source**: scale-assessor\n- **Location**: `GroupedList.swift:230`, `OutlineList.swift:257`, `SimpleList.swift:209`\n- **Details**: The requirement that all async apply methods participate in the `applyTask` cancellation chain is documented in AGENTS.md but not structurally enforced. A new contributor adding an async method could miss this pattern, causing subtle snapshot corruption.\n\n#### `MainActor.assumeIsolated` in layout configuration closures\n- **Source**: ios-platform-reviewer\n- **Location**: `Sources/Lists/Configurations/ListConfigurationBridge.swift:56-70`\n- **Details**: Runtime assertion that UIKit calls these closures on the main thread. Safe in practice per Apple's documentation, but would crash if Apple ever changes internal dispatch behavior. Standard trade-off for Swift 6 strict concurrency.\n\n#### Closure properties stored as strong references risk retain cycles\n- **Source**: ios-platform-reviewer\n- **Location**: `SimpleList.swift:107-127`, `GroupedList.swift:118-138`, `OutlineList.swift:152-172`\n- **Details**: `onSelect`, `onDelete`, `trailingSwipeActionsProvider`, etc. are stored as strong references. Users must use `[weak self]` to avoid retain cycles. This PR's doc comments warning about this are a good mitigation. Standard UIKit delegate/closure pattern.\n\n#### `assertionFailure` guards in ListConfigurationBridge resolve to silent no-ops in Release\n- **Source**: silent-failure-hunter\n- **Location**: `Sources/Lists/Configurations/ListConfigurationBridge.swift:83-88, 96-98, 108-110, 141-143, 176-182, 188-196`\n- **Details**: When `itemIdentifier(for:)` returns nil, the bridge fires `assertionFailure` and returns fallback values. In Release, these are silent no-ops. This is the correct UIKit pattern for transient index path mismatches during animations.\n\n---\n\n### Architecture Health\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| No circular dependencies | Pass | Strictly acyclic dependency graph confirmed by cycle-detector. All dependencies flow Configurations -> DataSource/Bridge -> Protocols/Utilities -> ListKit. |\n| Clean layer boundaries | Pass | Module boundary between ListKit and Lists is well-defined. New `ListConfigurable` and `AutoReconfigure` sit in correct layers. |\n| No god modules | Pass | No single file or type has disproportionate responsibility. Largest file is 465 lines (GroupedList), down from ~585 before PR. |\n| Consistent patterns | Pass | `// ABOUTME:` comments, `// MARK:` sections, `@MainActor` isolation, bridge pattern, and task serialization are consistent across all files. Minor deviation: free functions in `AutoReconfigure.swift` vs type-scoped convention elsewhere. |\n| Scalable structure | Pass | `ListConfigurable` protocol is the biggest scalability win -- eliminates ~65 lines of duplication per configuration. Adding a new list type now requires less boilerplate. |\n| Accessibility | Not assessed | No accessibility-specific agent was run. |\n| Localization readiness | Not assessed | No localization-specific agent was run. |\n| Concurrency safety | Pass | `@MainActor` isolation on all data sources and configurations. `Sendable` requirements satisfied. Cooperative cancellation via `Task.isCancelled` is correctly implemented. |\n| Performance efficiency | Pass | `computeItemsToReconfigure` is O(n) with hash lookup. No allocations in hot paths beyond the dictionary in `computeItemsToReconfigure` (which uses `reserveCapacity`). One minor note: `numberOfItems` changed from O(1) snapshot read to O(sections) UIKit calls. |\n| Platform conventions | Pass | `assertionFailure` + graceful fallback pattern matches Apple's own APIs. `@preconcurrency import UIKit` is the standard Swift 6 workaround. |\n\n---\n\n### Strengths\n- **Excellent deduplication**: The `ListConfigurable` protocol eliminates ~195 lines of duplicated convenience APIs across three configuration classes, replacing copy-paste with a single set of default implementations\n- **Clean extraction**: `AutoReconfigure.swift` consolidates previously duplicated content-change detection and section-snapshot flattening algorithms into well-documented shared functions\n- **Bug fix**: `OutlineList.setItems` and `MixedListDataSource.apply(_:to:)` now correctly route through `autoReconfigure` for `ContentEquatable` items, fixing a previously missing code path\n- **Comprehensive tests**: New tests cover direct apply, section model apply, DSL apply, section snapshot apply, and hierarchical section snapshots for the auto-reconfigure behavior\n- **Well-documented code**: Doc comments on all `ListConfigurable` default implementations, explanatory comments for `@objc` duplication, and `// ABOUTME:` comments on both new files\n- **No new dependencies**: The refactoring introduces no new external packages or cross-module dependencies\n- **Acyclic architecture preserved**: The dependency graph remains clean and strictly layered after the refactoring\n\n---\n\n### Action Plan\n\n1. **Before merge** (new important issue):\n   - Confirm whether the `numberOfItems`/`numberOfSections` behavioral change from snapshot-based to collection-view-based counting is intentional. If not, use `snapshot().numberOfItems` and `snapshot().numberOfSections` in the `ListConfigurable` default implementation.\n\n2. **Technical debt to track** (pre-existing issues):\n   - Monitor `@objc` delegate method duplication across list configurations as new delegate methods are added\n   - Consider enforcing the `applyTask` serialization pattern structurally if more async apply methods are added\n   - Revisit `MainActor.assumeIsolated` usage when Apple provides `@MainActor`-annotated closure signatures in future SDKs\n\n3. **Nice to have** (suggestions):\n   - Namespace the free functions in `AutoReconfigure.swift` with an `enum` to match the module's type-scoped convention\n   - Evaluate adding `sectionIdentifier(for:)` / `index(for:)` to `ListConfigurable` if the API asymmetry becomes a friction point\n   - Consider extracting common init-time wiring into a shared factory if a fourth list configuration is ever added\n","numLines":130,"startLine":1,"totalLines":130}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"13e1cdb3-92de-4aa0-86a8-d162f69cdc89"}

The new `ListConfigurable` extension reads from `collectionView.numberOfSections` / `collectionView.numberOfItems(inSection:)`, which queries the presentation layer. These can diverge during animated applies: the snapshot updates immediately but collection view counts may lag until animation completes. Also changes from O(1) snapshot read to O(sections) UIKit calls.\n- **Fix**: Restore `snapshot().numberOfItems` / `snapshot().numberOfSections` if the old behavior was intentional, or document the change.\n\n### Suggestions\n\n1. **Consider adding `sectionIdentifier(for:)` and `index(for:)` to `ListConfigurable`** — present on GroupedList/SimpleList via bridge but absent from protocol. May be intentional since OutlineList uses single hardcoded section.\n\n2. **Namespace the free functions in `AutoReconfigure.swift`** — `computeItemsToReconfigure` and `flattenSectionSnapshot` are the only module-level free functions. Wrapping in `enum AutoReconfigure` would match the type-scoped convention.\n\n3. **Silent return on section snapshot apply to non-existent section** — `assertionFailure` catches in debug but is stripped in Release. Matches Apple's API pattern; no change strictly needed.\n\n---\n\n### PRE-EXISTING ISSUES (technical debt, not PR-blocking)\n\n- **Duplicated `@objc` delegate forwarding (~150 lines)** — language limitation, correctly documented\n- **`applyTask` serialization chain is manual, not enforced** — documented in AGENTS.md but new contributors could miss it\n- **`MainActor.assumeIsolated` in bridge closures** — standard Swift 6 concurrency trade-off\n- **Closure properties risk retain cycles** — PR's new doc comments are good mitigation\n- **`assertionFailure` guards resolve to no-ops in Release** — correct UIKit pattern\n\n### Architecture Health: All checks pass\n\n### Strengths\n- Eliminates ~195 lines of duplicated convenience APIs via `ListConfigurable`\n- Clean extraction of shared algorithms into `AutoReconfigure.swift`\n- Fixes missing `autoReconfigure` code path for OutlineList/MixedListDataSource\n- Comprehensive new tests (5 scenarios)\n- No new dependencies, acyclic architecture preserved\n\n---\n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\nThe one actionable finding is subtle but important: `collectionView.numberOfSections` queries UIKit's *presentation state*, while `snapshot().numberOfSections` queries the *data source's logical state*. During animated transitions, these diverge because UIKit batches layout updates. If you call `numberOfItems` mid-animation, the collection-view-based version returns stale counts while the snapshot-based version returns the latest. For a framework like ListKit where users may chain operations, snapshot-based counting is generally safer.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nIndividual agent findings are available at `/tmp/deep-review-6984de4a-1fb7-4f65-b913-ed380bce0017/` for detailed inspection."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":726,"cache_read_input_tokens":98255,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":726,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"global"}},"requestId":"req_011CYRo3YsEq48NNFqhH4Sgk","type":"assistant","uuid":"eb6fae2a-0149-4779-bcc3-926a336c4b5a","timestamp":"2026-02-23T22:32:40.919Z"}

No circular dependencies, clean layer boundaries, consistent patterns, proper concurrency safety.\n- **Strengths**: Excellent deduplication (~195 lines removed), clean extraction of shared algorithms, bug fix for OutlineList/MixedListDataSource auto-reconfigure paths, comprehensive new tests.\n\nAll 8 agent reports were successfully synthesized with no gaps.\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"system\">\n{\"type\":\"teammate_terminated\",\"message\":\"code-reviewer-2 has shut down.\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"code-reviewer-2\" color=\"blue\">\n{\"type\":\"shutdown_approved\",\"requestId\":\"shutdown-1771885902023@code-reviewer-2\",\"from\":\"code-reviewer-2\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-23T22:31:45.339Z\",\"paneId\":\"in-process\",\"backendType\":\"in-process\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"system\">\n{\"type\":\"teammate_terminated\",\"message\":\"dependency-mapper has shut down.\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"system\">\n{\"type\":\"teammate_terminated\",\"message\":\"silent-failure-hunter-2 has shut down.\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"system\">\n{\"type\":\"teammate_terminated\",\"message\":\"cycle-detector has shut down.\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"system\">\n{\"type\":\"teammate_terminated\",\"message\":\"hotspot-analyzer has shut down.\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"system\">\n{\"type\":\"teammate_terminated\",\"message\":\"pattern-scout-2 has shut down.\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"system\">\n{\"type\":\"teammate_terminated\",\"message\":\"ios-platform-reviewer-2 has shut down.\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"system\">\n{\"type\":\"teammate_terminated\",\"message\":\"synthesizer has shut down.\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"system\">\n{\"type\":\"teammate_terminated\",\"message\":\"scale-assessor has shut down.\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"synthesizer\" color=\"blue\">\n{\"type\":\"idle_notification\",\"from\":\"synthesizer\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-23T22:31:46.408Z\",\"idleReason\":\"available\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"dependency-mapper\" color=\"yellow\">\n{\"type\":\"shutdown_approved\",\"requestId\":\"shutdown-1771885903050@dependency-mapper\",\"from\":\"dependency-mapper\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-23T22:31:46.468Z\",\"paneId\":\"in-process\",\"backendType\":\"in-process\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"silent-failure-hunter-2\" color=\"green\">\n{\"type\":\"shutdown_approved\",\"requestId\":\"shutdown-1771885902680@silent-failure-hunter-2\",\"from\":\"silent-failure-hunter-2\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-23T22:31:46.488Z\",\"paneId\":\"in-process\",\"backendType\":\"in-process\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"cycle-detector\" color=\"purple\">\n{\"type\":\"shutdown_approved\",\"requestId\":\"shutdown-1771885903579@cycle-detector\",\"from\":\"cycle-detector\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-23T22:31:46.888Z\",\"paneId\":\"in-process\",\"backendType\":\"in-process\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"hotspot-analyzer\" color=\"orange\">\n{\"type\":\"shutdown_approved\",\"requestId\":\"shutdown-1771885904212@hotspot-analyzer\",\"from\":\"hotspot-analyzer\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-23T22:31:47.668Z\",\"paneId\":\"in-process\",\"backendType\":\"in-process\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"pattern-scout-2\" color=\"pink\">\n{\"type\":\"shutdown_approved\",\"requestId\":\"shutdown-1771885904839@pattern-scout-2\",\"from\":\"pattern-scout-2\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-23T22:31:47.988Z\",\"paneId\":\"in-process\",\"backendType\":\"in-process\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"ios-platform-reviewer-2\" color=\"red\">\n{\"type\":\"shutdown_approved\",\"requestId\":\"shutdown-1771885906043@ios-platform-reviewer-2\",\"from\":\"ios-platform-reviewer-2\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-23T22:31:49.750Z\",\"paneId\":\"in-process\",\"backendType\":\"in-process\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"synthesizer\" color=\"blue\">\n{\"type\":\"shutdown_approved\",\"requestId\":\"shutdown-1771885906652@synthesizer\",\"from\":\"synthesizer\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-23T22:31:49.873Z\",\"paneId\":\"in-process\",\"backendType\":\"in-process\"}\n</teammate-message>\n\n<teammate-message teammate_id=\"scale-assessor\" color=\"cyan\">\n{\"type\":\"shutdown_approved\",\"requestId\":\"shutdown-1771885905403@scale-assessor\",\"from\":\"scale-assessor\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-02-23T22:31:49.894Z\",\"paneId\":\"in-process\",\"backendType\":\"in-process\"}\n</teammate-message>"},"uuid":"599e71a1-66ae-4959-8457-6387abaea826","timestamp":"2026-02-23T22:32:42.897Z"}

It provides:\n\n- **`CellViewModel` protocol** — the core abstraction tying cell content to diffable identity\n- **Data sources** — `ListDataSource` (single type) and `MixedListDataSource` (heterogeneous)\n- **Result builder DSL** — `@SnapshotBuilder`, `@ItemsBuilder`, `@MixedSnapshotBuilder`\n- **Pre-built configurations** — `SimpleList`, `GroupedList`, `OutlineList`\n- **SwiftUI wrappers** — `SimpleListView`, `GroupedListView`, `OutlineListView`\n- **Accessories** — `ListAccessory` enum mapping to `UICellAccessory`\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nLists/\n├── Protocols/\n│   ├── CellViewModel.swift          — Core protocol: Hashable + Sendable + cell configuration\n│   ├── ListConfigurable.swift       — Shared convenience APIs for list configurations\n│   └── SectionModel.swift           — Section metadata (header/footer text)\n├── DataSource/\n│   ├── AutoReconfigure.swift        — Shared content-change detection algorithm\n│   ├── ListDataSource.swift         — Single-cell-type data source with automatic registration\n│   └── MixedListDataSource.swift    — Heterogeneous cell types via AnyItem type erasure\n├── Builder/\n│   ├── SnapshotBuilder.swift        — @resultBuilder for single-type snapshots\n│   ├── ItemsBuilder.swift           — @resultBuilder for items within sections\n│   ├── MixedSnapshotBuilder.swift   — @resultBuilder for mixed-type snapshots (also defines MixedItemsBuilder and MixedSection)\n│   ├── DiffableDataSourceSnapshot+DSL.swift      — DSL extensions on Snapshot\n│   └── DiffableDataSourceSnapshot+MixedDSL.swift — Mixed DSL extensions\n├── Mixed/\n│   └── AnyItem.swift                — Type-erased CellViewModel wrapper (measured overhead)\n├── Configurations/\n│   ├── SimpleList.swift             — Single-section flat list\n│   ├── GroupedList.swift            — Multi-section with headers/footers\n│   ├── OutlineList.swift            — Hierarchical expand/collapse\n│   └── ListConfigurationBridge.swift — Shared configuration logic\n├── SwiftUI/\n│   ├── SimpleListView.swift         — SwiftUI wrapper for SimpleList\n│   ├── GroupedListView.swift        — SwiftUI wrapper for GroupedList\n│   ├── OutlineListView.swift        — SwiftUI wrapper for OutlineList\n│   ├── SwiftUICellViewModel.swift   — Protocol adding SwiftUI body + accessories\n│   ├── InlineCellViewModel.swift    — Type-erased inline SwiftUI content\n│   └── ListAccessory.swift          — Pure-Swift enum for UICellAccessory\n├── Extensions/\n│   ├── CellViewModel+Identifiable.swift   — Default Hashable/Equatable from id\n│   ├── LayoutHelpers.swift                — UICollectionLayoutListConfiguration shortcuts\n│   └── RefreshControlConfiguration.swift  — Pull-to-refresh support\n└── Lists.docc/                      — DocC documentation catalog\n```\n\n## Key Patterns\n\n### CellViewModel Protocol\n\nThe single most important type in this module. A `CellViewModel` must:\n1. Conform to `Hashable` and `Sendable`\n2. Declare an associated `Cell` type (a `UICollectionViewCell` subclass)\n3. Implement `func configure(_ cell: Cell)` to bind data to the cell\n\nThe default `Hashable`/`Equatable` implementations derive from `id`, provided by the `CellViewModel+Identifiable.swift` extension. Override only when content-based equality is needed.\n\n### Result Builder DSL\n\nThe builders allow declarative snapshot construction:\n```swift\ndataSource.apply {\n  SnapshotSection(\"favorites\") {\n    for item in favorites { item }\n  }\n  if showRecents {\n    SnapshotSection(\"recents\") {\n      for item in recents { item }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`@SnapshotBuilder` and `@MixedSnapshotBuilder` are top-level; `@ItemsBuilder` and `@MixedItemsBuilder` are used inside sections.\n\n### SwiftUI Integration\n\nSwiftUI wrappers use `UIViewRepresentable`. The `SwiftUICellViewModel` protocol extends `CellViewModel` with a SwiftUI `body` and optional `accessories`. `InlineCellViewModel` is the type-erased version for inline closures.\n\n### Mixed vs Single-Type\n\n- `ListDataSource<Item>` — fastest path, no type erasure\n- `MixedListDataSource` — wraps items in `AnyItem`, has measured overhead (~15-30%)\n- Prefer single-type unless the list truly has heterogeneous cell types\n\n## Critical Patterns\n\n### Task Serialization (`applyTask` chain)\n\nAny method that calls `await dataSource.apply(...)` **must** participate in the `applyTask` serialization chain. `@MainActor` does not prevent interleaving — `await` creates suspension points where other `@MainActor` code can run. Without serialization, overlapping applies corrupt snapshot state or header/footer dictionaries.\n\nThe pattern (used in `GroupedList.setSections`, `OutlineList.setItems`/`expand`/`collapse`, `MixedListDataSource.apply(content:)`):\n\n```swift\napplyTask?.cancel()\nlet previousTask = applyTask\nlet task = Task { [weak self] in\n  _ = await previousTask?.value          // wait for previous to finish\n  guard !Task.isCancelled, let self else { return }\n  // ... build snapshot, merge headers ...\n  await apply(snapshot, animatingDifferences: animatingDifferences)\n  // ... trim headers ...\n}\napplyTask = task\nawait withTaskCancellationHandler {\n  await task.value\n} onCancel: {\n  task.cancel()\n}\n```\n\nIf you add a new `async` method that applies snapshots, **you must use this pattern**.\n\n### Header/Footer Merge-Then-Trim\n\nWhen storing supplementary text (headers/footers) in dictionaries keyed by section ID, use the merge-then-trim strategy around animated applies:\n\n1. **Merge** new values into existing dictionaries *before* applying the snapshot — ensures both old (animating out) and new sections resolve valid text during the transition\n2. **Trim** to only new values *after* the apply completes — prevents stale entries from leaking\n\nThis pattern exists in `GroupedList.setSections` and `MixedListDataSource.apply(content:)`.\n\n### ListConfigurable Protocol\n\nThe `ListConfigurable` protocol (in `Protocols/ListConfigurable.swift`) provides shared convenience APIs across `SimpleList`, `GroupedList`, and `OutlineList`. It derives ~15 default implementations from just four requirements: `collectionView`, `snapshot()`, `itemIdentifier(for:)`, and `indexPath(for:)`.\n\nWhen adding a new convenience property or method that applies to all list configurations:\n1. **Add it to `ListConfigurable`'s protocol extension** — all three configurations get it automatically\n2. If the API needs configuration-specific behavior, add it directly to each configuration instead\n3. `@objc` delegate methods (UICollectionViewDelegate, UIScrollViewDelegate) cannot be provided by protocol extensions — these remain duplicated by necessity\n\n### Shared autoReconfigure Algorithm\n\nThe `computeItemsToReconfigure` function (in `DataSource/AutoReconfigure.swift`) implements the content-change detection algorithm shared by `ListDataSource` and `MixedListDataSource`. Each data source passes its own equality closure:\n- `ListDataSource`: type-level `ContentEquatable` check + `isContentEqualTypeErased`\n- `MixedListDataSource`: `AnyItem.isContentEqual(to:)` (per-item type erasure)\n\n## When Modifying This Module\n\n- New `CellViewModel` features must work with both `ListDataSource` and `MixedListDataSource`\n- Result builders must support `if`/`else`, `for`, and `Optional` in all positions\n- SwiftUI wrappers must call `updateUIView` correctly (avoid unnecessary reloads)\n- All configurations are `@MainActor` — don't break actor isolation\n- Any new `async` method that applies snapshots must use the `applyTask` serialization chain (see above)\n- Run `make test-lists` to verify changes\n- Run `make docs` if you changed any public API, doc comments (`///`), or files under `Lists.docc/` — commit the updated `docs/` output\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":137,"oldLines":11,"newStart":137,"newLines":13,"lines":[" 2.

Here's a summary of the fixes applied:\n\n### Fixes from deep review\n\n1. **`numberOfItems`/`numberOfSections` restored to snapshot-based counting** (NEW - Important)\n   - Changed from `collectionView.numberOfSections` back to `snapshot().numberOfSections`\n   - Changed from `collectionView.numberOfItems(inSection:)` back to `snapshot().numberOfItems`\n   - Restores O(1) performance and consistent behavior during animated transitions\n\n2. **Namespaced free functions into `DataSourceAlgorithms` enum** (Suggestion)\n   - Wrapped `computeItemsToReconfigure` and `flattenSectionSnapshot` in `enum DataSourceAlgorithms`\n   - Updated all call sites in `ListDataSource` and `MixedListDataSource`\n   - Matches the module's type-scoped organization convention\n\n3. **Updated `AGENTS.md`** to reflect the renamed `DataSourceAlgorithms` namespace\n\n### Issues not requiring code changes\n\nThe remaining pre-existing issues were all confirmed as either:\n- **Language limitations** (`@objc` delegate duplication — Swift protocol extensions can't provide ObjC dispatch)\n- **Correct patterns** (`assertionFailure` + fallback, `MainActor.assumeIsolated`, closure retain cycles documented with warnings)\n- **Already addressed** by the first round of fixes (doc comments on all 3 config classes)\n\nBuild passes, all 304 tests pass, docs regenerated.
